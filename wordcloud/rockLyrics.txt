Falling too fast to prepare for this Tripping in the world could be dangerous Everybody circling is vulturous Negative, Nepotist  Everybody waiting for the fall of man Everybody praying for the end of times Everybody hoping they could be the one I was born to run, I was born for this  Whip, whip Run me like a race horse Hold me like a rip cord Break me down and build me up I wanna be the slip, slip Word upon your lip, lip Letter that you rip, rip Break me down and build me up  Whatever it takes Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins I do whatever it takes Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains Whatever it takes Ya take me to the top, I'm ready for Whatever it takes Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins I do what it takes  Always had a fear of being typical Looking at my body feeling miserable Always hanging on to the visual I wanna be invisible  Looking at my years like a martyrdom Everybody needs to be a part of ���em Never be enough from the particle sum I was born to run, I was born for this  Whip, whip Run me like a race horse Hold me like a rip cord Break me down and build me up I wanna be the slip, slip Word upon your lip, lip Letter that you rip, rip Break me down and build me up  Whatever it takes Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins I do whatever it takes Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains Whatever it takes Ya take me to the top, I'm ready for Whatever it takes Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins I do what it takes  Hypocritical, egotistical Don't wanna be the parenthetical Hypothetical, working onto something that I'm proud of Out of the box an epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost I'm an apostrophe, I'm just a symbol to reminds you that there's more to see I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half diseased And when I am deceased At least I go down to the grave and I happily Leave the body of my soul to be a part of me I do what it takes  Whatever it takes Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins I do whatever it takes Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains Whatever it takes Ya take me to the top, I'm ready for Whatever it takes Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins I do what it takes

You say you never dance to a dashboard Singin' R.E.M under summer stars Never lean back on a jet black chevy Blowing smoke rings in the dark You don't want to be a rube girl And I feel just the same Yeah I know that you don't know me well But we can make that change  When was the last time you did something for the first time? Yeah, let yourself go and follow that feeling Maybe something new is what you're needing Like a real night, let your head down, feel alive When was the last time you did something for the first time?  Say you never drink from the bottle Or some two dollar wine, run barefoot through the mud Never have the right kiss stolen from your lips While you watch the Sun go up Well I know your friends are watching And they probably disapprove But give me just half a chance Girl I'm daring you  When was the last time you did something for the first time? Yeah, let yourself go and follow that feeling Maybe something new is what you're needing Like a real night, let your head down, feel alive When was the last time you did something for the first time?  Now the way you're looking says you're leaning I hope I ain't readin' you wrong Girl the way you're sounding, I think you're thinking It's been way too long  When was the last time you did something for the first time? Yeah, let yourself go and follow that feeling Baby something new is what you're needing Like a real night, let your head down, feel alive, alive When was the last time, oh, you did something for the first time girl? Tell me baby, when was the last time Yeah, you did something for the first time?

Don't think I've ever seen your kind of pretty Wandering around this midnight mad house city You got a look that says you got it all together So if you don't, mind I'd like to know you better  Take me the long way around your town Where you the queen with the silver crown I want the secrets you keep, the shine underneath Of the diamond I think I just found Take me the long way around  I'd love to see just where your daddy met your momma Your hand-me-down '99 Impala Show me the field you danced in clover The harvest in October When the leaves fall from the sky just like a Sunday drive  Take me the long way around your town Where you the queen with the silver crown I want the secrets you keep, the shine underneath Of the diamond I think I just found Take me the long way around  Didn't think tonight when I walked in I'd be falling for somewhere I've never been  Take me the long way around your town Where you the queen with the silver crown I want your red blushing stories Your faults and your glories That made you who you are right now Take me the long way around Take me the long way around
Just a young gun with a quick fuse  I was uptight, wanna let loose  I was dreaming of bigger things  And wanna leave my own life behind  Not a yes sir, not a follower  Fit the box, fit the mold  Have a seat in the foyer, take a number  I was lightning before the thunder   Thunder, feel the thunder  Lightning and the thunder  Thunder, feel the thunder  Lightning and the thunder  Thunder, thunder  Thunder   Kids were laughing in my classes  While I was scheming for the masses  Who do you think you are?  Dreaming 'bout being a big star  You say you're basic, you say you're easy  You're always riding in the back seat  Now I'm smiling from the stage  While you were clapping in the nose bleeds   Thunder, feel the thunder  Lightning and the thunder  Thunder, feel the thunder  Lightning and the thunder  Thunder   Thunder, feel the thunder  Lightning and the thunder, thunder   Thunder, feel the thunder  Lightning and the thunder, thunder  Thunder, feel the thunder  Lightning and the thunder, thunder  Thunder, feel the thunder  Lightning and the thunder, thunder  Thunder, feel the thunder  Lightning and the thunder, thunder

I was a boat stuck in a bottle That never got the chance to touch the sea Just forgot on the shelf No wind in the sails Going no where with no one but me  I was one in one-hundred billion A burned out star in a galaxy Just lost in the sky wondering why everyone else shines out but me  But... I came alive when I first kissed you The best me has his arms around you You make me better than I was before Thank God I'm yours  I was a worn out set of shoes Wondering the city street Another face in the crowd Head looking down Lost in the sound of a lonely melody Empty pockets at a roulette Always landing on a lost bet Just live for the spin and hope for the win Go all in just to lose again  But... I came alive when I first kissed you The best me has his arms around you You make me better than I was before Thank God I'm yours The worst me is just a long gone memory You put a new heart beat inside of me You make me better than I was before Thank God I'm yours  I was a boat stuck in a bottle That never got a chance to touch the sea  I came alive when I first kissed you The best me has his arms around you You make me better than I was before Thank God I'm yours The worst me is just a long gone memory You put a new heart beat inside of me You make me better than I was before Thank God I'm yours Thank God I'm yours Thank God I'm yours Thank God I'm yours

Please Could you love me anyway? Could you love me anyway? Could you love me anyway?

It was the summer before the real world started and, The deal was we would get to go, if we Cleaned it up, and got it running, Daddy's old Winnebago  Wing and a prayer down 65, Five best friends on four bald tires, I can still see Billy smiling When we finally made it  To Talladega, boys raised up, Whiskey in your glass, here's to turning up, Slowing down and cars that go real fast,  We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing, And thinking as that checkered flag was waving, Sure would like to stay in, Talladega  Like a storm, time rolls on, You can't hit pause as we just did. Most days in life don't stand out, But life's about those days that will, like,  Rocking rando, getting rowdy, Shooting roman candles at the man in the moon, til the Alabama sun was breaking.  Over Talladega, boys raised up, Whiskey in your glass, here's to turning up, Slowing down and cars that go real fast,  We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing, And thinking as that checkered flag was waving, Sure would like to stay in, Talladega  When the winds go cold and it blows October, I think about us shoulder to shoulder, Like those cars my thoughts roll over and over and over, In my mind.  Tonight I'm in Talladega, boys raised up, Whiskey in your glass, here's to turning up, Slowing down and cars that go real fast  We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing, And thinking as that checkered flag was waving, Sure would like to stay in, Talladega

Lonely soldier, go home Lonely but never alone Good eyes see nothing to shoot Good feet feel good giving up good boots  So ask your father how'd you fall Ask your father how'd you fall Like a leaf sitting on the ground Good for nothing 'cept kicking around  She died with her hands stretched out She died with a hungry mouth She died with her mind full of doubt And thoughts of weakening  So may your river never dry And may your mouth never lie And may you be satisfied to never know why Sometimes someone just wants to die  So where'd you get those cuts in your hand? I thought I told you about playing in the sand There's always someone careless with glass There's always questions you don't want to ask  She died with her hands stretched out She died with a hungry mouth She died with her mind full of doubt And thoughts of weakening  So may your river never dry And may your mouth never lie And may you be satisfied to never know why Sometimes someone just wants to die  So, lonely soldier, go home Lonely but never alone Good eyes see nothing to shoot Good feet feel good giving up good boots

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  And though I never got her name Or time to find out anything I loved her just the same  And though I rode a different road And sang a different song I'll love her till my last breaths gone  Like a river - made of silver Everyone came running to the scene I was shot down - in cold blood By an angel in blue jeans  Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh...  Late that night she got away I chased her to the turnpike Then lost her where the music never plays  And though I rolled upon the stones and fell into the water I'll love her till my judgment day  Like a sunrise - made of white lines Everything was nothing as it seems I was shot down - in cold blood By an angel in blue jeans  Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh, woah oh oh oh oh oh  I hear voices calling all around I keep falling down I think my heart could pound right out of me I see a million different ways To never leave this maze alive  I woke up in somebody's arms Strange and so familiar Where nothing could go wrong  Barely alive or nearly dead Somehow awake in my own bed And there you are  Like a highway - headed my way Life is but a dream I was shot down - by your love My angel in blue jeans  Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh, woah oh oh oh oh Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah ah

I like fast cars, and shop grease chased a lot of crazy things left behind my share of broken pieces this morning I turned 36, and you just remember half of it you wonder how you out-lived Hank and Jesus  I put the rage in a river, the roll in a thunder but you kept me from goin' under, when that current got too heavy I always thought I'd be a heap of metal in a cloud of smoke, foot stuck to the pedal Sold for parts like a junkyard rusted-out Chevy Fear, I've had none what the hell made you want to love a man, who was gonna die young  In the mirror, I saw my surprise when those gray hairs like to hide, on my head didn't think he'd live past thirty If I make it thirty more, it's the brown that you'll be looking for as you run your fingers through, say "slow down, honey"  I put the rage in a river, the roll in a thunder but you kept me from goin' under, when that current got too heavy I always thought I'd be a heap of metal in a cloud of smoke, foot stuck to the pedal Sold for parts like a junkyard rusted-out Chevy Fear, I've had none what the hell made you want to love a man, who was gonna die young  Call it intuition, or call it crazy just thought by now I'd be pushing up daisies but I'd gladly stick around if we're together So baby when you bow your head tonight could you tell the Lord I've changed my mind? And with you I'd like to live, well...

On your side of the bed, there's a picture of our wedding day A clock that don't work and a bible that your daddy gave It's on the window side, where the moon creeps in at night Staring at the ceiling, lying here all alone I said a prayer for you then I said one of my own But you don't reach for me, when you lie down quietly  Tell me how, how'd you get so far away? All we have left are the memories of the love we made Are you sleeping with your own regret? On your side of the bed  On your side of the bed there's a burnt down candle flame A letter I've started but I didn't know what to say No I couldn't write it down, so I try to say it now  Tell me how, how'd you get so far away? All we have left are the memories of the love we made Are you sleeping with your own regret? On your side of the bed  Aren't you even gonna make a sound? Your side of the bed Turn the other way when I turn the lights down Your side of the bed Are you lonely? Like I'm lonely?  How, how'd you get so far away? All we have left are the memories of the love we made Are you sleeping with your own regret? Tell me how, how'd you get so far away? All we have left are the memories of the love we made Are you sleeping with your own regret? On your side of the bed On your side of the bed Are you still awake, on your side of the bed?

Well I woke up to the sound of silence The cars were cutting like knives in a fist fight And I found you with a bottle of wine Your head in the curtains And heart like the fourth of July You swore and said We are not We are not shining stars This I know I never said we are Though I've never been through hell like that I've closed enough windows To know you can never look back  If you're lost and alone Or you're sinking like a stone Carry on May your past be the sound Of your feet upon the ground Carry on Carry on, carry on  So I met up with some friends At the edge of the night At a bar off 75 And we talked and talked About how our parents will die All our neighbors and wives But I'd like to think I can cheat it all To make up for the times I've been cheated on And it's nice to know When I was left for dead I was found and now I don't roam these streets I am not the ghost you want of me  If you're lost and alone Or you're sinking like a stone Carry on May your past be the sound Of your feet upon the ground And carry on  Woah My head is on fire But my legs are fine After all, they are mine Lay your clothes down on the floor Close the door, hold the phone Show me how No one's ever gonna stop us now  'Cause we are We are shining stars We are invincible We are who we are On our darkest day When we're miles away So we'll come We will find our way home  If you're lost and alone Or you're sinking like a stone Carry on May your past be the sound Of your feet upon the ground Carry on Carry on, carry on  No one's ever gonna stop us now
Sometimes it feels like, I'm gonna break Sometimes this world, gives more than I can take Sometimes, sunshine gets lost in the rain And it keeps pouring down It just keeps coming down. This life would kill me If I didn't have you  I couldn't live without you baby I wouldn't want to If you didn't love me so much I'd never make it through 'Cause this life would kill me This life would kill me if I didn't have you.  You are my heart, every breath I breathe I'm safe in your arms, you rescue me. When I'm weak, you're strong If you were gone I don't know where I'd be You were made for me (You were made for me) This life would kill me If I didn't have you  I couldn't live without you baby I wouldn't want to If you didn't love me so much I'd never make it through 'Cause this life would kill me This life would kill me if I didn't have you  If you didn't love me so much (If you didn't love me so much) This life would kill me If I didn't have you (This life would kill me) Couldn't live without you baby  I wouldn't want to If you didn't love me so much I'd never make it through 'Cause this life would kill me This life would kill me if I didn't have you

To the man that waited on me At the Starbucks down on Main I hope you understand When I put on that t-shirt The only thing I meant to say Is I'm a Skynyrd fan The red flag on my chest somehow is Like the elephant in the corner of the south And I just walked him right in the room Just a proud rebel son with an 'ol can of worms Lookin' like I got a lot to learn But from my point of view  I'm just a white man comin' to you from the southland Tryin' to understand what it's like not to be I'm proud of where I'm from but not everything we've done And it ain't like you and me can re-write history Our generation didn't start this nation We're still pickin' up the pieces, walkin' on eggshells, fightin' over yesterday And caught between southern pride and southern blame  They called it Reconstruction, fixed the buildings, dried some tears We're still siftin' through the rubble after a hundred-fifty years I try to put myself in your shoes and that's a good place to begin But it ain't like I can walk a mile in someone else's skin  Cause I'm a white man livin' in the southland Just like you I'm more than what you see I'm proud of where I'm from but not everything we've done And it ain't like you and me can re-write history Our generation didn't start this nation And we're still paying for the mistakes That a bunch of folks made long before we came And caught somewhere between southern pride and southern blame  Dear Mr. White Man, I wish you understood What the world is really like when you're livin' in the hood Just because my pants are saggin' doesn't mean I'm up to no good You should try to get to know me, I really wish you would Now my chains are gold but I'm still misunderstood I wasn't there when Sherman's March turned the south into firewood I want you to get paid but be a slave I never could Feel like a new fangled Django, dodgin' invisible white hoods So when I see that white cowboy hat, I'm thinkin' it's not all good I guess we're both guilty of judgin' the cover not the book I'd love to buy you a beer, conversate and clear the air But I see that red flag and I think you wish I wasn't here  I'm just a white man (If you don't judge my do-rag) Comin' to you from the southland (I won't judge your red flag) Tryin' to understand what it's like not to be I'm proud of where I'm from (If you don't judge my gold chains) But not everything we've done (I'll forget the iron chains) It ain't like you and me can re-write history (Can't re-write history baby)  Oh, Dixieland (The relationship between the Mason-Dixon needs some fixin') I hope you understand what this is all about (Quite frankly I'm a black Yankee but I've been thinkin' about this lately) I'm a son of the new south (The past is the past, you feel me) And I just want to make things right (Let bygones be bygones) Where all that's left is southern pride (RIP Robert E. Lee but I've gotta thank Abraham Lincoln for freeing me, know what I mean) It's real, it's real It's truth

Everybody down in Huston calls him "Texas". Everybody way up North calls him "Cornbread". You shoulda heard the way that his momma called him "baby" daddy called him "boy", his friends call him "crazy". Shoulda just called it like I saw it. Shoulda just called for help and ran like hell that day. The burning, the stinging, the high and the heat and the "left-me-wanting-more" feeling when he kissed me. I shoulda just called him "Whiskey". Warm my body to the core just like a blanket. His face was so sweet then he took my breath away. Hit me so hard like a rock through a window. I knew I was in trouble from the moment I met you, boy. Shoulda just called it like I saw it. Shoulda just called for help and ran like hell that day. The burning, the stinging, the high and the heat and the "left-me-wanting-more" feeling when he kissed me. I shoulda just called him "Whiskey" Now the numb has set in. He's gone like the wind. And I can barely feel the pain. Shoulda just called it like I saw it. Shoulda just called for help and ran like hell that day. The burning, the stinging, the high and the heat and the "left-me-wanting-more" feeling when he kissed me. The burning, the stinging, the high and the heat and the "left-me-wanting-more" feeling when he kissed me. I shoulda just called him "Whiskey". Shoulda just called him "Whiskey". I shoulda just called him "Whiskey".

All these kinds of places make it seem like it's been ages Tomorrow some new building will scrape the sky I love this country dearly I can feel the ladder clearly But I never thought I'd be alone to try Once I was outside Penn Station selling red and white carnations  We were still alone my wife and I Before we married saved my money Brought my dear wife over Now I work to bring my family stateside But off the boat they stayed awhile then scattered across the coast Once a year I'll see them for a week or so at most I take a walk  (take a walk, take a walk, take a walk, take a walk...) I take a walk (take a walk, take a walk, take a walk, take a walk...)  Practice isn't perfect but the market cuts the loss  I remind myself that times could be much worse My wife won't ask me questions There's not so much to ask And she'll never flaunt around an empty purse Once my mother-in-law came just to stay a couple nights  Then decided she would stay the rest of her life I watch my little children play some board game in the kitchen And I sit and pray they never feel my strife But then my partner called to say the pension funds were gone He made some bad investments now the accounts are overdrawn I take a walk  (take a walk, take a walk, take a walk, take a walk...) I take a walk (take a walk, take a walk, take a walk, take a walk...) Honey, it's your son I think I borrowed just too much We had taxes, we had bills, we had a lifestyle to front  And tonight I swear I'll come home and we'll make love like we're young And tomorrow you'll cook dinner for the neighbors and their kids  We can rip apart those socialists and all their damn taxes  But see I am no criminal, I'm down on both bad knees I'm just too much a coward, to admit when I'm in need I take a walk (take a walk, take a walk, take a walk, take a walk...) I take a walk (take a walk, take a walk, take a walk, take a walk...) I take a walk (take a walk, take a walk, take a walk, take a walk...) I take a walk (take a walk, take a walk, take a walk, take a walk...)

I remember when my heart caught the fever You were standing all alone in the summer heat I was with my boyfriend, my new boyfriend He was as sweet as he could be  One look at you and I was through My heart switched up on me  Like a postcard from Paris When I've seen the real thing It's like finding out your diamond is From her old promise ring  A call back from your fortune teller She read your cards upside down The meanest thing you ever did is Come around  And now I'm ruined, yeah I'm ruined  In the evening you can catch me daydreaming Did that moment send you reeling just like me I should have gone over, right over I should have never let you leave  But it's the never knowing that keeps This going and drives me crazy  Like a postcard from Paris When I've seen the real thing It's like finding out your diamond is From her old promise ring  A call back from your fortune teller She read your cards upside down The meanest thing you ever did is Come around  Just when I thought things were alright My eyes played tricks on my mind Will I ever be satisfied 'Cause all I ever seem to find, is a  Postcard from Paris When I need the real thing It's like finding out your diamond is From an old promise ring  A call back from your fortune teller She read your cards upside down The meanest thing you ever did The cruelest thing you ever did The meanest thing you ever did Is come around  I am ruined, yeah I'm ruined Now I am ruined, yeah I'm ruined
I dropped you off Just a little after midnight Sat in my car Till you turned off your porch light I should have kissed you I should have pushed you up against the wall I should have kissed you Just like I wasn't scared at all  I turned off the car Ran through the yard Back to your front door Before I could knock You turned the lock  And met me on the front porch  And I kissed you Goodnight  And now that I've kissed you It's a good night good night baby goodnight  You couldn't see me Watching through the window Wondering what went wrong Praying that you wouldn't go You should have kissed me  You should have pushed me up against the wall You should have kissed me I was right on the edge and ready to fall  So I turned off the car Ran through the yard  Back to your front door Before I could knock You turned the lock And met me on the front porch  And I kissed you Goodnight And now that I've kissed you It's a good night good night baby goodnight  I turned off the car ran through the yard back to your front door I was scared to death Can't catch my breath Aren't these the moments we live for And I kissed you Goodnight And now that I've kissed you It's a good night good night baby goodnight It's a good night good night baby goodnight It's a good night good night baby goodnight It's a good night good night baby goodnight
Trying to live and love, With a heart that can't be broken, Is like trying to see the light with eyes that can't be opened. Yeah, we both carry baggage, We picked up on our way, so if you love me do it gently, And I will do the same.  We may shine, we may shatter, We may be picking up the pieces here on after, We are fragile, we are human, We are shaped by the light we let through us, We break fast, cause we are glass. Cause we are glass.  I'll let you look inside me, through the stains and through the cracks, And in the darkness of this moment, You see the good and bad. But try not to judge me, 'cause we've walked down different paths, But it brought us here together, so I won't take that back.  We may shine, we may shatter, We may be picking up the pieces here on after, We are fragile, we are human, We are shaped by the light we let through us, We break fast, cause we are glass.  We might be oil and water, this could be a big mistake, We might burn like gasoline and fire, It's a chance we'll have to take.  We may shine, we may shatter, We may be picking up the pieces here on after, We are fragile, we are human, And we are shaped by the light we let through us, We break fast, cause we are glass. We are glass.
The sky in Cheyenne, Wyoming Is just about as blue as it gets And if you ain't seen a Santa Fe sunset You ain't seen red  Texas sunflower yellow Can take your breath away I've seen it all, from the orange of the fall To the green of the summer but my favorite color is  Neon The light they always leave on A weekend on the rocks An old school jukebox With a little Johnny Lee on  The buzz I love to be on You put a double on your troubles The light at this end of the tunnel Is neon  The sun can do the job in the daytime But the moon ain't quite bright enough To light up the way to playtime For people like us  Just like a beach side beacon Callin' all the ships back home A few thousand volts to cut through the smoke The windows are tinted that's why they invented  Neon The light they always leave on A weekend on the rocks An old school jukebox With a little Johnny Lee on  It's the buzz I love to be on You put a double on your troubles The light at this end of the tunnel Is always neon  You know I've seen it all From the orange of the fall To the green of the summer But my favorite color is Neon The light they always leave on Put a double on your troubles The light at this end of the tunnel Is neon

Way back on the radio dial a fire got lit inside a bright eyed child Every note just wrapped around a soul from steel guitars to Memphis on the way to rock and roll  Oh, I can hear em' playing. I can hear the ringing on a beat up old guitar Oh, I can hear em singing Keep on dreaming even if it breaks your heart  Down town is where i used to wonder Old enough to get there but to young to get inside So i would stand outside the sidewalk listen to the music playing every Friday night  Oh, I can hear em playing I can hear the ringing of the beat of old guitar Oh, I can hear em singing. Keep on dreaming Even if it breaks your heart  Some dreams stay with you forever Drag you around and bring you back to where you were Some dreams keep on getting better Gotta keep believing if you wanna know for sure  Oh, I can hear em playing I can hear the ringing of the beat of old guitar Oh, I can hear em singing Keep on dreaming Even if it breaks your heart  Oh, I can hear em playing I can hear the ringing of the beat of old guitar Oh, I can hear em singing Keep on dreaming Even if it breaks your heart  Keep on dreaming Even if it breaks . your heart. Ohhh, Ohhh Keep on dreaming ohhh, ohhh, Don't let em break your heart
Blonde hair blowin' in the summer wind A blue-eyed girl playin' in the sand I'd been on her trail for a little while But that was the night that she broke down and held my hand A teenage rush She said, "Ain't we all just runaways? We got time" But that ain't much We can't wait 'til tomorrow You gotta know that this is real, baby, why you wanna fight it? It's the one thing you can choose, oh!  We got engaged on a Friday night I swore on the head of our unborn child That I could take care of the three of us But I got the tendency to slip when the nights get wild It's in my blood She said she might just runaway somewhere else Someplace good We can't wait 'til tomorrow You gotta know that this is real, baby, why you wanna fight it? It's the one thing you can choose Let's take a chance baby, we can't lose  Ain't we all just runaways? I knew it when I met you, I'm not gonna let you runaway I knew it when I held you,  I wasn't lettin' go! We used to look at the stars and confess our dreams Hold each other 'til the morning light We used to laugh, now we only fight  Baby are you lonesome now? At night I come home after they go to sleep Like a stumbling a ghost, I haunt these halls There's a picture of us on our wedding day  I recognize the girl but I can't settle in these walls We can't wait 'til tomorrow Oh we're caught up in the appeal baby, why you wanna hide it? It's the last thing on my mind  (Why you wanna hide it?) I turn the engine over and my body just comes alive Ain't we all just runaways? I knew it when I met you, I'm not gonna let you runaway I knew it when I held you, I wasn't lettin' go! Oh! oh! oh! oh! oh! Ain't we all just runaways? Yeah, runaways Ain't we all just runaways? Yeah
Don't give up I know you can see All the world and the mess that were making Can't give up And hope God will intercede Come on back Imagine that we could get it together Stand up for what we need to be Cause crime won't save our feet or hungry child Can't lay down and hope no miracles change things So lift up your eyes Lift up your heart  Singing mercy will we overcome this Oh one by one could we turn it around Maybe carry on just a little bit longer And I try to give you what you need  Me and you and you and you Just want to be free yeah But you see all the world is just as we've made it And until we got a new world Got to say that love is not a whisper or a weakness No love is strong So we got to get together yeah Gotta get gotta get gotta get Til there is no reason To fight  Mercy will we overcome this Oh one by one could we turn it around Maybe carry on just a little bit longer And I try to give you what you need  Yeah... Ah... Oh...  Yeah... Mercy will we overcome this Oh we come to far to turn it around Oh and asked too much to be a little bit stronger But I want to give you what you need Mercy what will become of us Oh one by one could we turn it around Maybe carry on just a little bit longer And I try to give you what you need

You know my old car needs washing And the front yard needs a trim And the telephone keeps ringing And the bossman knows I know its him And the bills ain't gonna pay themselves No matter anyway Cause I ain't in no hurry today  There's nothing wrong with an old cane fishing pole And the smell of early spring Sit down in a fold-up easy chair On a quiet shady river bank Let the world go on without me Wouldn't have it any other way Cause I ain't in no hurry today  Ain't in no hurry I'd Be a fool now to worry About all those things I can't change And the time that I borrow Can wait till tomorrow Cause I ain't in no hurry today  When I must return To the cold cold ground Have 'em take their time When they lay this sinner down  Heaven knows that I ain't perfect I've raised a little cain And I plan to raise a whole lot more Before I hear those angels sing (Gonna get right with the lord) But there'll be hell to pay But I ain't in no hurry  Ain't in no hurry Be a fool now to worry About all those things I can't change And the time that I borrow Can wait till tomorrow Cause I ain't in no hurry Ain't in no hurry Ain't in no hurry today

Now and then I think of when we were together Like when you said you felt so happy you could die Told myself that you were right for me But felt so lonely in your company But that was love, and it's an ache I still remember  You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness Like resignation to the end, always the end So when we found that we could not make sense Well, you said that we would still be friends But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over  But you didn't have to cut me off Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing And I don't even need your love But you treat me like a stranger, and that feels so rough  No, you didn't have to stoop so low Have your friends, collect your records, and then change your number I guess that I don't need that though Now you're just somebody that I used to know  Now you're just somebody that I used to know Now you're just somebody that I used to know  Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over But had me believing it was always something that I'd done  But I don't wanna live that way Reading into every word you say You said that you could let it go And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know  But you didn't have to cut me off Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing And I don't even need your love But you treat me like a stranger, and that feels so rough  No, you didn't have to stoop so low Have your friends, collect your records, and then change your number I guess that I don't need that though Now you're just somebody that I used to know  Somebody (I used to know) Somebody (now you're just somebody that I used to know) Somebody (I used to know) Somebody (now you're just somebody that I used to know)  I used to know That I used to know I used to know Somebody
Some nights, I stay up cashing in my bad luck Some nights, I call it a draw Some nights, I wish that my lips could build a castle Some nights, I wish they'd just fall off But I still wake up, I still see your ghost Oh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for What do I stand for What do I stand for Most nights, I don't know Anymore  So this is it, boys, this is war What are we waiting for Why don't we break the rules already I was never one to believe the hype Save that for the black and white Try twice as hard and I'm half as liked But here they come again to jack my style And that's alright I found a martyr in my bed tonight She stops my bones from wondering just who I am, who I am, who I am Oh, who am I? Mmm, mmm  Well, some nights, I wish that this all would end 'Cause I could use some friends for a change And some nights, I'm scared you'll forget me again Some nights, I always win (I always win) But I still wake up, I still see your ghost Oh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for What do I stand for, oh What do I stand for Most nights, I don't know  (Oh, c'mon) So this is it I sold my soul for this Washed my hands of that for this I miss my mom and dad for this No, when I see stars, when I see stars, that's all they are When I hear songs, they sound like the swan So come on Oh, come on! Oh, come on! Oh, come on!  Well, that is it, guys, that is all Five minutes in and I'm bored again Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands This one is not for the folks back home Sorry to leave, mom, I had to go Who the fuck wants to die alone all dried up in the desert sun  My heart is breaking for my sister And the con that she called "love" And then I look into my nephew's eyes Man, you wouldn't believe the most amazing things That can come from Some terrible lies  The other night, you wouldn't believe The dream I just had about you and me I called you up but we'd both agree It's for the best you didn't listen It's for the best we get our distance, oh It's for the best you didn't listen It's for the best we get our distance, oh
You know I'd fall apart without you I don't know how you do what you do 'Cause everything that don't make sense about me Makes sense when I'm with you  Like everything that's green, girl, I need you But it's more than one and one makes two Put aside the math and the logic of it You gotta know you're wanted too  'Cause I wanna wrap you up Wanna kiss your lips I wanna make you feel wanted And I wanna call you mine Wanna hold your hand forever And never let you forget it Yeah, I wanna make you feel wanted  Anyone can tell you you're pretty, yeah And you get that all the time, I know you do But your beauty's deeper than the make-up And I wanna show you what I see tonight...

Last night, outta the blue Driftin' off to the evening news She said, "Honey, what would you do If you'd have never met me"  I just laughed, said "I don't know, But I could take a couple guesses though" And then tried to dig real deep, Said, "Darling honestly..."  I'd do a lot more offshore fishin' I'd probably eat more drive-thru chicken Take a few strokes off my golf game If I'd have never known your name  I'd still be driving that old green ���Nova I probably never would have heard of yoga I'd be a better football fan But if I was a single man Alone and out there on the loose  Well I'd be looking for a woman like you. I could tell that got her attention So I said, "Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, I wouldn't trade a single day For 100 years the other way." She just smiled and rolled her eyes, Cause she's heard all of my lines  I said, "C'mon on girl, seriously If I hadn't been so lucky, I'd be. Shootin' pool in my bachelor pad Playing bass in my cover band Restocking up cold Bud Light  For poker every Tuesday night, yeah I'd have a dirt bike in the shed And not one throw pillow on the bed I'd keep my cash in a coffee can But if I was a single man Alone and out there on the loose Well I'd be looking for a woman like you.  She knows what a mess I'd be if I didn't have her here But to be sure, I whispered in her ear You know I get sick deep-sea fishin' And you make the best fried chicken I got a hopeless golf game I love the sound of your name  I might miss that old green ���Nova But I love watchin' you do yoga I'd take a gold band on my hand Over being a single man Cause honestly I don't know what I'd do If I'd never met a woman like you.

It's been a long hard ride, Got a ways to go But this is still the place That we all call home.  Brave, gotta call it brave To chase that dream across the sea.

A million miles away Your signal in the distance To whom it may concern  I think I lost my way Getting good at starting over Every time that I return  I'm learning to walk again I believe I've waited long enough Where do I begin?  I'm learning to talk again Can't you see I've waited long enough Where do I begin? Do you remember the days We built these paper mountains Then sat and watched them burn  I think I found my place Can't you feel it growing stronger Little conquerors  I'm learning to walk again I believe I've waited long enough Where do I begin?  I'm learning to talk again I believe I've waited long enough Where do I begin? Now For the very first time Don't you pay no mind Set me free again You keep alive a moment at a time But still inside a whisper to a riot To sacrifice but knowing to survive The first to climb another state of mind I'm on my knees, I'm praying for a sign Forever, whenever I never wanna die I never wanna die I never wanna die I'm on my knees I never wanna die I'm dancing on my grave I'm running through the fire Forever, whenever I never wanna die I never wanna leave I never say goodbye Forever, whenever Forever, whenever  I'm learning to walk again I believe I've waited long enough Where do I begin? I'm learning to talk again Can't you see I've waited long enough Where do I begin? I'm learning to walk again I believe I've waited long enough I'm learning to talk again Can't you see I've waited long enough
The first time we did it I was scared to death She snuck out in that cotton dress Jumped on in and we drove to the lake Put her hand on my knee and said I can't wait I had everything we needed in the bed of my truck Turns out my baby loves to...  Fish, she wants to do it all the time Early in the morning, in the middle of the night She's hooked and now she can't get enough Man, that girl sure loves to fish  After that that's all she wanted to do But that was okay 'cause I did too She always wants to go down by the dam And I love how she looks with that rod in her hand If they ain't bitin' she don't give up Turns out my baby loves to...

Fish, I love to see her lyin' There on the bank 'neath the full moon light Man, I can't even believe my luck I found a girl who loves to...  Fish, she wants to do it all the time Early in the morning, in the middle of the night She's hooked and now she can't get enough Man, that girl sure loves to fish Yeah, I know she loves to fish Psst, you awake, let's fish
I can't get my feet up off the edge I kinda like the little rush you get When you're standing close to death Like when you're driving me crazy  Hold on as we crash into the earth A bit of pain will help you suffer when you're hurt For real. 'Cause you are driving me crazy  Bite your lips Your word's a robbery Do you grin inside? You're killing me All along we talked of forever I kinda think that we won't get better It's the longest start But the end's not too far away  Did you know I'm here to stay? We'll stagger home after midnight Sleep arm in arm in the stairwell  We'll fall apart on the weekend These nights go on and on and on I can't get your voice out of my head All I hear are the many echoes of the darkest words you said  And it's driving me crazy I can't find the best in all of this But I'm always looking out for you 'cause you're the one I miss  And it's driving me crazy Bite your lips Your word's a robbery Do you grin inside? You're killing me All along we talked of forever I kinda think that we won't get better It's the longest start  But the end's not too far away Did you know I'm here to stay?

Gonna put the the world away for a minute Pretend I don't live in it Sunshine gonna wash my blues away  Had sweet love but I lost it She got too close so I fought her Now I'm lost in the world trying to find me a better way  Wishing I was knee deep in the water somewhere Got the blue sky breeze and it don't seem fair Only worry in the world is the tide gonna reach my chair Sunrise there's a fire in the sky Never been so happy Never felt so high And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise  Wrote a note said be back in a minute Bought a boat and I sailed off in it Don't think anybody gonna miss me anyway  Mind on a permanent vacation The ocean is my only medication Wishing my condition ain't ever gonna go away  Cause now im knee deep in the water somewhere Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair Only worry in the world is the tide gonna reach my chair Sunrise there's a fire in the sky Never been so happy Never felt so high And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise  This champagne shore washing over me It's a sweet sweet life living by the salty sea One day you could be as lost as me Change you're geography Maybe you might be  Knee deep in the water somewhere Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair Only worry in the world is the tide gonna reach my chair Sunrise there's a fire in the sky Never been so happy Never felt so high And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise  Come on in the water it's nice Find yourself a little slice Grab a backpack of lies You never know until you try When you lose yourself You find the key to paradise
Don't worry, baby, sometimes things change Nothin' we can do about it now, no way This doesn't come easy, but that's just life We can't keep pretendin' everything's alright  We told each other it was love before The simple truth is it just ain't no more The bells stop ringin', the music won't play The crazy little feelin' that's faded away  Like snowflakes when the weather warms up Like leaves on the trees when the autumn comes Like the dogwood blossoms in a late spring rain All the disappearin' bubbles in a glass of champagne  Like a red kite lost in a blue sky wind I don't know where the good times end when It ain't nothin' we ever said or ever did wrong It's just love done gone  I don't regret a single thing that we did Anytime together, we ever spent I wouldn't change a thing, baby, you know Sometimes we gotta just go with the flow  Like snowflakes when the weather warms up Like leaves on the trees when the autumn comes Like the dogwood blossoms in a late spring rain All the disappearin' bubbles in a glass of champagne  Like money in a slot machine Don't know what happened to you and me It ain't nothin' we ever said or ever did wrong It's just love done gone It's just love done gone It's just love done gone

Everyone wants to call it all around our life with a better name. Everyone falls and spins, and gets up again with a friend who does the same. Everyone lies and cheats their wants and needs and still believes their heart. And Everyone gets the chills, the kind that kills when the pain begins to start.

They keep me up all night Everyone's cross to bears the crown they wear on endless holiday. Everyone raises kids in a world that changes life to a bitter game. Everyone works and fights, stays up all night to celebrate the day. And everyone lives to tell the tale of how we die alone some day.  Did I get this straight, do you want me here? As I struggle through each and every year. And all these demons, they keep me up all night.  They keep me up all night

Gone cast away in time Evil yours, now evil mine So I robbed you blind The voices in my head  Suggest a less than peaceful side The endless possibilities Controlling 1-3-5  You can't break me! Crushed the fears of yesterday You can't change me! Barriers our trust will fade  I've stood in the dark Been waiting all this time While we damn the dead I'm trying to survive  I'm not ready to die  Damned, watch the masses fall Burn it down, control ���em all (Help me)Make me crawl To daddy's little girl To read the writings on the wall  While cast into the nothingness The final curtain calls  You can't break me! Crushed the fears of yesterday You can't change me! Barriers our trust will fade  I've stood in the dark Been waiting all this time While we damn the dead I'm trying to survive  I'm not ready to die  Through the madness we find Loyalty is no match for power Say goodbye to your life Left to rot in your darkest hour Friends won't help you now as long as you're mine  You can't break me! Crushed the fears of yesterday You can't change me! Barriers our trust will fade  I've stood in the dark Been waiting all this time While we damn the dead I'm trying to survive I'll control the world one person at a time As I damn the dead I'm trying to survive I'm not ready to die Oh! I'm not ready to die I'm not ready to die! I'm not ready to die! I'm not ready to die! Ready to die! (Ready to die!) (Ready to die!)

Shake me down Not a lot of people left around Who knows now Softly laying on the ground, oh ooh Not a lot people left around, oh ooh oh ooh In my life, I have seen People walk into the sea Just to find memories Plagued by constant misery Their eyes cast down Fixed upon the ground Their eyes cast down I'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun Shake me down Cut my hair on a silver cloud Broken sound Softly laying on the ground oh ooh Not a lot people left around, oh ooh oh ooh In my past, bittersweet There's no love between the sheets Taste the blood, broken dreams Lonely times indeed With eyes cast down Fixed upon the ground Eyes cast down I'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun Turn back now its time for me to let go Way down had to find a place to lay low Lampshade turned around into a light post Walk around the corner Never saw it coming still I try to make a move It almost stopped me from belief I don't wanna know the future But I'm like rolling thunder Even on a cloudy day Even on a cloudy day Even on a cloudy day Even on a cloudy day Even on a cloudy day Even on a cloudy day Even on a cloudy day I'll keep my eyes fixed on the- I'll keep my eyes fixed on the- I'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun Shake me down Not a lot of people left around, oh ooh, oh ooh

Now I grew up down an old dirt road In a town you wouldn't know My pops picked the place up for fifteen hundred bucks Back in nineteen sixty-four  My grandfather was a drinker Back in the day, he put 'em down But a war is known to change a man And the whiskey's known to change a man  But that's not me  I rarely drink from the bottle but I'll smoke a little weed I still live in the sticks where you wouldn't go In a town of twelve hundred off an old dirt road And a country boy is all I'll ever be  Now, it's been twelve years since I sold my soul To the devil in L.A.

All the promises we made One by one they vanish just the same  Of all the things I still remember Summer's never looked the same The years go by and time just seems to fly But the memories remain  In the middle of September we'd still play out in the rain Nothing to lose but everything to gain Reflecting now on how things could've been It was worth it in the end  Now it all seems so clear, there's nothing left to fear So we made our way by finding what was real Now the days are so long that summer's moving on We reach for something that's already gone, yeah  Of all the things I still remember Summer's never looked the same The years go by and time just seems to fly But the memories remain  In the middle of September we'd still play out in the rain Nothing to lose but everything to gain Reflecting now on how things could've been It was worth it in the end  We knew we had to leave this town But we never knew when and we never knew how We would end up here the way we are Yeah, we knew we had to leave this town But we never knew when and we never knew how  Of all the things I still remember Summer's never looked the same The years go by and time just seems to fly But the memories remain In the middle of September we'd still play out in the rain Nothing to lose but everything to gain Reflecting now on how things could've been It was worth it in the end
Christmas night, another fight Tears we cried a flood Got all kinds of poison in Of poison in my blood  I took my feet to Oxford street Trying to right a wrong "Just walk away" those windows say But I can't believe she's gone When you're still waiting for the snowfall Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all  Up above candles on air flicker Oh they flicker and they flow  And I am up here holding on to all those chandeliers of hope And like some drunken Elvis singing I go singing out of tune Singing how I always loved you darling  And I always will Oh when you're still waiting for the snow to fall It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all Still waiting for the snow to fall  It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all Those Christmas Lights  Light up the street Down where the sea and city meet  May all your troubles soon be gone Ohh Christmas Lights keep shining on Those Christmas Lights Light up the street Maybe they'll bring her back to me  Then all my troubles will be gone Oh Christmas Lights keep shining on Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh Oh Christmas Lights Light up the streets Light up the fireworks in me May all your troubles soon be gone Those Christmas Lights keep shining on
Everyday I fight for all my future somethings A thousand little wars I have to choose between I could spend a lifetime earning things that I don't need But that's like chasing rainbows and coming home empty  And if you strip me, strip it all away If you strip me, what would you find? If you strip me, strip it all away I'll be alright  Take what you want Steal my pride, build me up or cut me down to size Shut me out, but I'll just scream I'm only one voice in a million, but you ain't taking that from me  You ain't taking that from me (You ain't taking that from me) You ain't taking that from me You ain't taking that  I don't need a microphone To say what I've been thinking My heart is like a loudspeaker That's always on 11  And if you strip me, strip it all away If you strip me, what would you find? If you strip me, strip it all away I'm still the same  Take what you want Steal my pride, build me up or cut me down to size Shut me out, but I'll just scream I'm only one voice in a million, but you ain't taking that from me  No, you ain't taking that from me You ain't taking that from me (You ain't taking that from me) You ain't taking that  'Cause when it all boils down at the end of the day It's what you do and say that makes you who you are Makes you think about it, think about it, doesn't it? Sometimes all it takes is one voice  Take what you want Steal my pride, build me up or cut me down to size Shut me out, but I'll just scream I'm only one voice in a million, but you ain't taking that from me  No, you ain't taking that from me You ain't taking that from me (You ain't taking that from me) You ain't taking that Take what you want Steal my pride, build me up or cut me down to size Shut me out, but I'll just scream I'm only one voice in a million, but you ain't taking that from me No, you ain't taking that from me You ain't taking that from me (You ain't taking that from me) You ain't taking that
No more trouble,  In this town.  Silent night, for a change.   Brand new year,  Coming up ahead.  You know its been so long,  Since I rang one in?   I close my eyes,  Think about the path I took.  Just when I think these times,  Have gotten the best of me.   I can see my mother in the kitchen.  My father on the floor,  Watching television.  It's a wonderful life.   Cinnamon candles burning.  Snowball fights outside.  Smile below each nose and above each chin.   Stomp my boots before I go back in.   I wasted my wishes,  On Saturday nights.  Boy what I would give,  For just one more.   I soften my heart,   Shocked the world.  Do you hear my voice?  Do you know my name?  Light my way,  Lift my head.  Light my way,   I can see my mother in the kitchen.  My father on the floor,  Watching television.  It's a wonderful life.   Cinnamon candles burning.  Snowball fights outside.  Smile below each nose and above each chin.   Family all together.  Presents piled high.  Frost on all the windows,  What a wonderful night.   Cinnamon candles burning.  Snowball fights outside.  Smile below each nose and above each chin.   So happy they found me,  Love was all around me.  Stomp my boots before I go back in.

When I was younger I saw my daddy cry And curse at the wind. He broke his own heart and I watched As he tried to reassemble it.  And my momma swore That she would never let herself forget. And that was the day that I promised I'd never sing of love if it does not exist.  But darling, You are the only exception. You are the only exception. You are the only exception. You are the only exception.  Maybe I know somewhere deep in my soul That love never lasts. And we've got to find other ways to make it alone. Or keep a straight face.  And I've always lived like this Keeping a comfortable distance. And up until now I have sworn to myself That I'm content with loneliness.  Because none of it was ever worth the risk.  Well you are the only exception. You are the only exception. You are the only exception. You are the only exception.  I've got a tight grip on reality, But I can't let go of what's in front of me here. I know you're leaving in the morning when you wake up. Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream. Oh-oh-oh-ohhh.  You are the only exception You are the only exception You are the only exception You are the only exception  You are the only exception You are the only exception You are the only exception You are the only exception  And I'm on my way to believing Oh, and I'm on my way to believing
I can feel her breath as she's sleeping next to me Sharing pillows & cold feet  She can feel my heart, fell asleep to its beat Under blankets & warm sheets  If only I could be in that bed again If only it were me instead of him  Does he watch your favorite movies? Does he hold you when you cry? Does he let you tell him all your favorite parts when you've seen it a million times? Does he sing to all your music while you dance to Purple Rain? Does he do all these things like I used to?  Fourteen months & seven days ago Oh, I know you know how we felt about that night  Just your skin against the window Oh, we took it slow & we both know  It should have been me inside that car It should have been me instead of him in the dark  Does he watch your favorite movies? Does he hold you when you cry? Does he let you tell him all your favorite parts when you've seen it a million times? Does he sing to all your music while you dance to Purple Rain? Does he do all these things like I used to?  I know, Love (I'm a sucker for that feeling) Happens all the time, Love (I always end up feeling cheated) You're on my mind, Love (Oh darling, led her where that leaded) It happens all the time, Love, yeah  Will he love you like I loved you? Will he tell you every day? Will he make you make you feel like you're invincible with every word he'll say? Can you promise me if this was right?

If I could Hug my love Could I try For your wings To cover me  And let them fold Half alive I heard the most  Brilliant lie Sleepless eyes Close the light  And dust the mind While I burn ...

Cry on black rain Cry on black rain  Cry on black rain ... If I could Hug my love Could I try Fold your wings To cover me Unless I fall Sleepless eyes Close the light And dust the mind While i burn ... You can't stutter When you're talking with your eyes Like cutting out your tongue To save face Or feeding on the blood That's running from a black day

Do you know what's worth fighting for When it's not worth dying for? Does it take your breath away And you feel yourself suffocating?  Does the pain weigh out the pride And you look for a place to hide? Did someone break your heart inside? You're in ruins  One, 21 guns Lay down your arms, give up the fight One, 21 guns Throw up your arms into the sky, you and I  When you're at the end of the road And you lost all sense of control And your thoughts have taken their toll When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul  Your faith walks on broken glass And the hangover doesn't pass Nothing's ever built to last You're in ruins  One, 21 guns Lay down your arms, give up the fight One, 21 guns Throw up your arms into the sky, you and I  Did you try to live on your own When you burned down the house and home? Did you stand too close to the fire? Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone  When it's time to live and let die And you can't get another try Something inside this heart has died You're in ruins  One, 21 guns Lay down your arms, give up the fight One, 21 guns Throw up your arms into the sky  One, 21 guns Lay down your arms, give up the fight One, 21 guns Throw up your arms into the sky, you and I

(he was a, ya know it, he was a...)  I was walking down the street When out the corner of my eye I saw a pretty little thing approaching me She said, I've never seen a man, who looks so all alone, uh, could you use a little company? if you pay the right price, your evening will be nice and you can go and send me on my way I said "You're such a sweet young thing why'd you do this to yourself?" she looked at me and this is what she said  "Oh, there ain't no rest for the wicked, money don't grow on trees, I got bills to pay, I got mouths to feed, there ain't nothing in this world for free, I know I can't slow down, I can't hold back, though you know, I wish I could oh, no there ain't no rest for the wicked  until we close our eyes for good  not even fifteen minutes later, I'm still walking down the street when I saw the shadow of a man creep out of sight and then he swept up from behind and put a gun up to my head, he made it clear he wasn't looking for a fight, he said "Give me all you've got, I want your money not your life, but if you try to make a move I won't think twice I told him "You can have my cash,  but first you know I got to ask,  "what made you want to live this kind of life?"  he said "There ain't no rest for the wicked, money don't grow on trees,  I got bills to pay,  I got mouths to feed,  there ain't nothing in this world for free, I know I can't slow down,  I can't hold back, though you know, I wish I could  Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked,  until we close our eyes for good" yeah,  (you know it,  he was a,  you know it,  he was a...)  Well now a couple hours passed, and I was sitting at my house, the day was winding down and coming to an end An' so I turned on the TV and flipped it over to the news and what I saw I almost couldn't comprehend  I saw a preacher man in cuffs, he'd taken money from the church, he'd stuffed his bank account with righteous dollar bills, but even still I can't say much, becauseI know we're all the same, oh yes, we all seek out to satisfy those thrills, you know there ain't no rest for the wicked, money don't grow on trees, we got bills to pay, we got mouths to feed, there ain't nothing in this world for free, I know we can't slow down, we can't hold back, though you know, we wish we could, oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked, until we close our eyes for good
It's been a long week I've got a slow leak in my left front tire ... I'm sick of where I work  My boss is such a jerk, don't care if I get fired ... My back's about to break No money in the bank  And she don't call me anymore ... I'm down to my last drink, it's time to sell my things  And pack my bags and never look back Run a parallel line with the railroad tracks ... And make my getaway  ... I'll put the pedal to the metal as the sun goes down Leave everybody sleepin' in this sleepy town tonight ...  At the break of day I'll be a runaway ... A hundred miles in, I got a stupid grin  On my scruffy face ... With every cigarette I'm burnin' my regrets  Don't want to leave a trace And from the rearview, I've got clear view Of who I used to be A little bit faster now Ddon't wanna turn around  I'm gonna pack my bags and never look back Run a parallel line with the railroad tracks ... And make my getaway  ... I'll put the pedal to the metal as the sun goes down Leave everybody sleepin' in this sleepy town tonight  ... And at the break of day I'll be a runaway, I'll be a runaway (I'll be a runaway, I'll be a runaway, I'll be a runaway) It's crazy, I know, to count on this road To give me what I need But with every state line Somehow I find another part of me, yeah, yeah ... I'm gonna pack my bags and never look back Run a parallel line with the railroad tracks ... And make my get away ... I'll put the pedal to the metal as the sun goes down Leave everybody sleepin' in this sleepy town tonight ... And at the break of day I'll be a runaway, I'll be a runaway (I'll be a runaway, I'll be a runaway, I'll be a runaway) (I'll be a runaway, I'll be a runaway, I'll be a runaway) ...

Chances are when said and done Who'll be the lucky ones Who make it all the way? Though you say I could be your answer Nothing lasts forever No matter how it feels today  Chances are, we'll find a new equation Chances roll away from me Chances are all they hope to be  Don't get me wrong I never say never Cause though love can change the weather No act of God could pull me away from you  I'm just a realistic man A bottle filled with shells and sand Afraid to look beyond what I can lose when it comes to you And though I see us through, yeah  Chances are, we'll find two destinations Chances roll away from me Still, chances are more than expectations But possibilities... Over me It's a fight with two to one Lay your money on the sun Until you crash, what have you done? Is there a better bet than love? What you are is what you bring You've got to cry before you sing  Chances... Chances...  Chances lost are hope's torn-out pages Maybe this time... Chances are, we'll be the combination Chances come and carry me Chances are waiting to be taken And I can see Chances are, the fascination Chances won't escape from me Chances are only what we make them And all I need.

Drivin' down the street today Saw the sign for lemonade They were the cutest kids I've seen in this front yard  As they handed me my glass Smiled and thinkin' to myself Man what a picture perfect postcard this would make Of America  It's a high school prom It's a Springsteen song It's a ride in a Chevrolet It's a man on the moon And fireflies in June Kids sellin lemonade It's cities and farms And open arms One nation under God It's America  Later on when I got home I flipped the TV on I saw a little town that some big Twister tore apart People came from miles around Just to help their neighbors out And I was thinkin' to my self I'm so glad that I live in America  It's a high school prom It's a Springsteen song It's a ride in a Chevrolet It's a man on the moon And fireflies in June Kids sellin lemonade It's cities and farms And open arms One nation under God It's America  Now we might not always get it right But there's nowhere else I rather build my life  Cause it's a kid with a chance It's a rock n roll band It's a farmer cuttin' hay  It's a big flag flyin' in the summer wind Over a fallen hero's grave.  It's a high school prom It's a Springsteen song It's a welcome home parade It's a man on the moon And fireflies in June Kids sellin lemonade It's cities and farms And open arms One nation under God It's America
I feel so unsure As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor As the music dies Something in your eyes Calls to mind a silver screen And all it's sad goodbyes  I'm never gonna dance again These guilty feet have got no rhythm Though it's easy to pretend I know you're not a fool I should have known better than to cheat a friend And waste the chance that I'd been given So I'm never gonna dance again The way I danced with you  Time can never mend The careless whispers of a good friend To the heart and mind Ignorance is kind There's no comfort in the truth Pain is all you'll find  I'm never gonna dance again These guilty feet have got no rhythm Though it's easy to pretend I know you're not a fool I should have known better than to cheat a friend And waste the chance that I'd been given So I'm never gonna dance again The way I danced with you  Tonight the music seems so loud I wish that we could lose this crowd Maybe it's better this way We've hurt each other with the things we want to say  We could have been so good together We could have lived this dance forever Now who's gonna dance with me  Please stay  I'm never gonna dance again These guilty feet have got no rhythm Though it's easy to pretend I know you're not a fool  I should've known better than to cheat a friend And waste this chance that I've been given So I'm never gonna dance again The way I danced with you

Lying in the park on a beautiful day Sunshine in the grass, and the children play Siren's passing, fire engine red Someone's house is burning down on a day like this  The evening comes and we're hanging out On the front step and a car rolls by with the windows rolled down And that war song is playing, why can't we be friends? Someone is screaming and crying in the apartment upstairs  Funny the way it is, if you think about it Somebody's going hungry and someone else is eating out Funny the way it is, not right or wrong Somebody's heart is broken and it becomes your favorite song  The way your mouth feels in your lovers kiss Like a pretty bird on a breeze or water to a fish A bomb blast brings a building crashing to the floor You hear the laughter while the children play war  Funny the way it is, if you think about it One kid walks 10 miles to school, another's dropping out Funny the way it is, not right or wrong On a soldier's last breath his baby's being born  Standing on a bridge, watch the water passing under me It must've been much harder when there was no bridge just water Now the world is small, remember how it used to be With mountains and oceans and winters and rivers and stars  Watch the sky, the jet planes, so far out of my reach Is there someone up there looking down on me? Boy chase a bird, so close but every time He'll never catch her, but he can't stop trying  Funny the way it is, if you think about it One kid walks 10 miles to school, another's dropping out Funny the way it is, not right or wrong On a soldier's last breath his baby's being born Funny the way it is, not right or wrong Somebody's broken heart becomes your favorite song Funny the way it is, if you think about it A kid walks 10 miles to school, another's dropping out  Standing on a bridge, watch the water passing under me It must've been much harder when there was no bridge just water Now the world is small, remember how it used to be With mountains and oceans and winters and rivers and stars

On a three hour flight from Memphis to L.A. I was silently celebrating my first-class upgrade Laughing at my jeans and my boots Beside those high dollar shoes and Armani suits  When the gentleman next to me said the drinks up here are free So, if you'd like the first one can be on me He said, I'm heading back from business in New York and Rome Tell me son, where do you call home?  I said, I'm from the front pew of a wooden white church A court house clock that still don't work Where a man's word means everything Where moms and dads were high school flames Gave their children grandmothers' maiden name Yes, it may not sound like much But that's where I'm from  So we drank that round and then another There wasn't a topic in this world we did not cover He said, I headed out west when I was barley nineteen Just a kid, chasing my dreams  And I said, I'm flying out here to pick up my big brother He's been fighting the cancer they discovered But he called last night, and said I think this is the end So come take me home to my family an my friends  Where the quarterback dates the homecoming queen The trucks are Ford and the tractors green And amazing grace is what we'd sing Where there's a county fair every fall And your friends are there no matter when you call Yeah it may not sound like much But it's where I'm from  And as we stood to claim the bags we checked He said I'll pray for your bother and did I mention That Italian suits haven't always been my style? See I was the quarterback of my high school team We took state back in '63 And my wife well, she still my home coming queen  Cause I'm from the front pew of a wooden white church A court house clock that still don't work Where a man's word means everything Where moms and dads were high school flames Gave their children grandmothers' maiden name Yes it may not sound like much I said it may not sound like much But it's where I'm from It's where I'm from It's where I'm from

Is this the moment where I look you in the eye? Forgive my broken promise that you'll never see me cry And everything, it will surely change Even if I tell you I won't go away today  Will you think that you're all alone When no one's there to hold your hand?

And when they say it's all touch and go I wish I could make it go away but still you say  Will you think that you're all alone When no one's there to hold your hand? When all you know seems so far away And everything is temporary, rest your head I'm permanent, I'm permanent Is this the moment where I look you in the eye?

I used to rule the world Seas would rise when I gave the word Now in the morning I sleep alone Sweep the streets I used to own  I used to roll the dice Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes Listen as the crowd would sing "Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"  One minute I held the key Next the walls were closed on me And I discovered that my castles stand Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand  I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing Roman Calvary choirs are singing Be my mirror, my sword and shield My missionaries in a foreign field  For some reason I can't explain Once you go there was never Never an honest word And that was when I ruled the world  It was the wicked and wild wind Blew down the doors to let me in Shattered windows and the sound of drums People couldn't believe what I'd become  Revolutionaries wait For my head on a silver plate Just a puppet on a lonely string Oh who would ever want to be king?  I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing Roman Calvary choirs are singing Be my mirror, my sword and shield My missionaries in a foreign field  For some reason I can't explain I know Saint Peter won't call my name Never an honest word But that was when I ruled the world  I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing Roman Calvary choirs are singing Be my mirror, my sword and shield My missionaries in a foreign field  For some reason I can't explain I know Saint Peter won't call my name Never an honest word But that was when I ruled the world

What are the things that you say, say, say to me?  'Cause you're a tragedy A queen for his majesty All these plans for me Your kingdom is crumbling  You're a tragedy A queen for his majesty All these plans for me Your kingdom is crumbling  Somebody turn the lights on Somebody tell me what's wrong I'd be lying if I told you Losing you was something I could handle Somebody turn the lights on Somebody tell me how long All this darkness will surround you 'Cause I'm burning for you Burning like a candle Burning for you Burning like a candle Burning for you Burning like a candle

Shadows fill an empty heart As love is fading From all the things that we are But are not saying Can we see beyond the scars And make it to the dawn?  Change the colors of the sky And open up to The ways you made me feel alive The ways I loved you For all the things that never died To make it through the night Love will find you  What about now? What about today? What if you're making me all that I was meant to be? What if our love never went away? What if it's lost behind words we could never find? Baby, before it's too late What about now?

Normally this time of night you wouldn't find me here I'd be reachin' for a good night kiss instead of one more beer I'd never take a second look at the blonde across the bar Much less invite her over and let things go this far   But anything goes when everything's gone You ain't around to give a damn whether I do right or wrong So bring it on, anything goes when everything's gone  Another mornin' after a crazy night before I'm searchin' for my blue jeans on a stranger's bedroom floor Well, shouldn't I feel guilty well I don't feel a thing I'd wake her up and say goodbye, but I can't recall her name  But anything goes when everything's gone You ain't around to give a damn whether I do right or wrong So bring it on, anything goes when everything's gone  If you'd of left a single thread for me to hold on too I'd have one good reason not to do the things I do  But anything goes when everything's gone You ain't around to give a damn whether I do right or wrong So bring it on, anything goes when everything's gone  Anything goes Anything goes when everything's gone
You can't forget what love was wearing When it walked out your front door Where you fell down to your knees And can't forget the kind of suitcase That was packed out on the sidewalk While you cried there beggin' please But love remembers  You can lie and tell yourself You're over it and someone else will take love's place And this is for the best You can lie in that bed In a stranger's arms reachin' for comfort Close your eyes and still get no rest  Cause love remembers The smell of a summer day Lying in a hammock over fresh cut grass And the promise of forever Yeah love remembers The sound of the pouring rain Beatin' down on the top of a car On the side of the road Where it couldn't wait Yeah love remembers  You might convince yourself There's shelter in a bottle For a while there it might numb the pain But when it hits you, then it hits you That love's still gone and you'll be wishin' That you'd poured it down the drain 'Cause love remembers  The taste of cotton candy lip gloss On the lips of a long kiss And the plans they made together Yeah love remembers To feel the fingertips Running through soakin' wet hair On the bank after a midnight swim Yeah love remembers  Yeah love remembers The smell of a summer day Lying in a hammock over fresh cut grass And the promise of forever Love remembers The sound of the pouring rain Beatin' down on the top of a car On the side of the road Where it couldn't wait Yeah love remembers  Love remembers (Love remembers) (The sound of the pouring rain) Beatin' down on the top of a car (On the side of the road) (Where it couldn't wait)

I nodded, yeah and said, "How 'bout you" He said, "Son since nineteen fifty-two I've been waitin' on a woman"  "And when I picked her up for our first date I told her, I'd be there at eight" And she came down the stairs at eight-thirty She said, "I'm sorry that I took so long Didn't like a thing that I tried on" But let me tell you son, she sure looked pretty Yeah, she'll take her time but I don't mind Waitin' on a woman  He said the wedding took a year to plan You talk about an anxious man, I was nervous And waitin' on a woman And then he nudged my arm like old men do And said, "I'll say this 'bout the honeymoon, it was worth it Waitin' on a woman"  And I don't guess we've been anywhere She hasn't made us late I swear Sometimes she does it just 'cause she can do it Boy, it's just a fact of life It'll be the same with your young wife Might as well go on and get used to it She'll take her time 'cause you don't mind Waitin' on a woman  I've read somewhere statistics show The man's always the first to go And that makes sense 'cause I know she won't be ready So when it finally comes my time And I get to the other side I'll find myself a bench, if they've got any I hope she takes her time, 'cause I don't mind Waitin' on a woman Honey, take your time, 'cause I don't mind Waitin' on a woman
We were 18, it was prom night. We had our first big fight. She said "Pull this car over". I did and then I told her, "I don't know what you are crying for". I grabbed her hand, as she reached for the door.  She said, I'll walk. Let go of my hand. Right now I'm hurt, and you don't understand. So just be quiet. And later we will talk. Just leave, don't worry. I'll walk.  It was a dark night, a black dress. Driver never saw her, around the bend. I never will forget the call, or driving to the hospital, when they said her legs still wouldn't move. I cried, when I walked into her room.    She said, I'll walk. Please come and hold my hand. Right now I'm hurt, and I don't understand. Lets just be quiet, and later we can talk. Please stay, don't worry. I'll walk.  I held her hand through everything. The weeks and months of therapy. And I held her hand and asked her, to be my bride. She's dreamed from a little girl, to have her daddy bring her down the aisle. So from her wheelchair, she looks up to him and smiles.  And says, I'll walk. Please hold my hand. I know that this will hurt, I know you understand. Please daddy don't cry. This is already hard. Let's go, don't worry. I'll walk.

Can you feel your life the way I feel your love And the biggest chance that we can take Is open arms and wide awake hold me now So we can feel alive  Oh, we were so lost And there was so much more than you could bear And i was cold in my defeat You're alone and incomplete When the sound could break down the walls  Can you feel real like you are? Can you feel your life the way I feel your love And the biggest chance that we can take Is open arms and wide awake Hold me now So we can feel alive So I can feel alive Tonight

Was a long and dark December From the rooftops I remember There was snow White snow Clearly I remember From the windows they were watching While we froze down below When the future's architectured By a carnival of idiots on show You'd better lie low If you love me Won't you let me know? Was a long and dark December When the banks became cathedrals And a fox became God Priests clutched onto bibles Hollowed out to fit their rifles And the cross was held aloft Bury me in armor When I'm dead and hit the ground My nerves are poles that unfroze If you love me Won't you let me know? I don't want to be a soldier Who the captain of some sinking ship Would stow, far below So if you love me Why'd you let me go? I took my love down to violet hill Then we sat in snow All that time she was silent still So if you love me Won't you let me know? If you love me Won't you let me know?

Night time sharpens, heightens each sensation  Darkness stirs and wakes imagination  Silently the senses abandon my defenses   Softly, gently, night unfits its splendor  Grasp it, sense it, tremulous and tender  Turn your face away from the garish light of day  Turn your thoughts away from cold, unfeeling light  And listen to the music of the night   Let your mind start a journey through a strange new world  Leave all thoughts of the world you knew before  Let your soul take you where you long to be  Only then can you belong to me   Floating, falling, sweet intoxication  Touch me, trust me, savor each sensation  Let the dream begin, let your darkest side give in  To the power of the music that I write  The power of the music of the night, of the night   You alone can make my song take flight  Help me make the music of the night

I am stuck here in a moment And I'm trying to pretend So I'll play this feeling over and over again  I know all this memory Maybe I should awake instead But I'm on my way to go back inside my head  I close my eyes And try to hide But I wake when these dreams collide  So I'll put this all on repeat And I'll make up what comes next Now I lay here, daydreaming on your chest  I close my eyes And try to hide But I wake when these dreams collide But it all breaks down if I  Keep on wasting all my time All alone, in my head Wish I'd never thought about it in the end  I close my eyes And try to hide But I wake when these dreams collide

We were born to mothers who smoked and drank Our cribs were covered in lead-based paint No childproof lids No seatbelts in cars Rode bikes with no helmets And still here we are Still here we are  We got daddy's belt when we misbehaved Had three TV channels you got up to change No video games and no satellite All we had were friends and they were outside Playing outside  It was a different life When we were boys and girls Not just a different time It was a different world  School always started the same everyday The pledge of allegiance, then someone would pray Not every kid made the team when they tried We got disappointed but that was alright We turned out alright  It was a different life When we were boys and girls Not just a different time It was a different world  No bottled water We'd drink from a garden hose And every Sunday, All the stores were closed.  It was a different life When we were boys and girls Not just a different time It was a different world  It was a different life When we were boys and girls Not just a different time It was a different world  It was a different world

Iiiiiiiieeeeeee Icky thump Who'da thunk?  Sittin' drunk on a wagon to Mexico. Ah well, What a chump  Well my head got a bump When I hit it on the radio. Redhead se��orita Looking dead  Came and said "need a bed?" En Espa��ol. I said "gimme a drink a water  I'm gonna "sing around the collar And I don't need a microphone."  Icky thump with a lump in my throat Grabbed my coat And I was freaking I was ready to go!  And I swear Besides the hair She had one white eye One black(nk) stare Lookin' up Lyin' there.  On the stand near her hand Was a candy cane Black rum, sugar cane Dry ice (and) something strange.  La la, la la la la la la la la la laaa laaa laaa  White Americans, what? Nothing better to do? Why don't you kick yourself out?  You're an immigrant too? Who's usin' who? What should we do? Well you can't be a pimp And a prostitute too  Icky thump, handcuffed to a bunk Robbed blind Looked around And there was nobody else Left alone I hit myself with a stone Went home And learned how to clean up after myself

(Annie Tateu002FSam Tateu002FDave Berg)  I was coming to the end of a long, long walk When a man crawled out of a cardboard box Under the E. Street Bridge Followed me on to it I went out halfway across With that homeless shadow tagging along So I dug for some change Wouldn't need it anyway He took it lookin' just a bit ashamed He said, You know, I haven't always been this way  I've had my moments, days in the sun Moments I was second to none Moments when I knew I did what I thought I couldn't do Like that plane ride coming home from the war That summer my son was born And memories like a coat so warm A cold wind can't get through Lookin' at me now you might not know it But I've had my moments  I stood there tryin' to find my nerve Wondering if a single soul on Earth Would care at all Miss me when I'm gone That old man just kept hanging around Lookin' at me, lookin' down I think he recognized That look in my eyes Standing with him there I felt ashamed I said, You know, I haven't always been this way  I've had my moments, days in the sun Moments I was second to none Moments when I knew I did what I thought I couldn't do Like the day I walked away from the wine For a woman who became my wife And a love that, when it was right, Could always see me through Lookin' at me now you might not know it But I've had my moments  I know somewhere 'round a trashcan fire tonight That old man tells his story one more time He says  I've had my moments, days in the sun Moments I was second to none Moments when I knew I did what I thought I couldn't do Like that cool night on the E. Street Bridge When a young man almost ended it I was right there, wasn't scared a bit And I helped to pull him through Lookin' at me now you might not know it Oh, lookin' at me now you might not know it But I've had my moments  I've had my moments I've had my moments I've had my moments

I had a one night stand with my best friends baby sister And to this day he still wont speak to me I pawned my grandpa's old guitar in college For a case of beer and a tank of gasoline I took a swing at my old man one Christmas I never dreamed that it would be his last I wish mom had wrung my neck When she caught me with those cigarettes Which reminds me, I'm down to my last pack  If I had a dime For half the things I did That didn't make no sense at all I'd be living a little higher on the hog  If only I'd've known That later on down the road I'd look back and not like what I see I'd've changed a lot of things Startin' with me  I called my brother everything I could think of The night he wouldn't bail me out of jail I lost a job most folks ���round here would die for By laying out all night and raising hell And I let a woman that I love slip through my fingers Chalk another dumb move up to my foolish pride I wasn't there standin' by the bed When the preacher bowed his head With the family, the day my grandma died  If I had a dime For half the things I did That didn't make no sense at all I'd be living a little higher on the hog If only I'd've known That later on down the road I'd look back and not like what I see I'd've changed a lot of things Startin' with me  If only I'd've known That later on down the road I'd look back and not like what I see Whoa, I'd've changed a lot of things Startin' with me Startin' with me
I was sittin' there sellin' turnips on a flatbed truck Crunchin' on a pork rind when she pulled up She had to be thinkin' "This is where the rednecks come from" She had Hollywood written on her license plate She was lost and lookin' for the interstate Needin' directions and I was the man for the job  I told her way up yonder past the caution light There's a little country store with an old Coke sign You gotta stop in and ask Miss Bell for some of her sweet tea Then a left will take you to the interstate But a right will bring you right back here to me I was sittin' there thinkin' 'bout her pretty face  Kickin' myself for not catchin' her name I threw my hat and thought, "You fool, that coulda been love" I knew my old Ford couldn't run her down She probably didn't like me anyhow So I watched her disappear into a cloud of dust.  I told her way up yonder past the caution light There's a little country store with an old Coke sign You gotta stop in and ask Miss Bell for some of her sweet tea Then a left will take you to the interstate But a right will bring you right back here to me Is this Georgia heat playin' tricks on me Or am I really seein' what I think I see  The woman of my dreams comin' back to me She went way up yonder past the caution light Don't know why, but somethin' felt right When she stopped in and asked Miss Bell for some of her sweet tea Mama gave her a big 'ol glass and sent her right back here to me Thank God for good directions: and turnip greens
I wandered through fiction to look for the truth Buried beneath all the lies And I stood at a distance to feel who you are Hiding myself in your eyes  And hold on before it's too late We'll run 'til we leave this behind Don't fall, just be who you are It's all that we need in our lives  And the risk that might break you Is the one that would save A life you don't live is still lost  So stand on the edge with me Hold back your fear and see Nothing is real 'til it's gone  And hold on before it's too late We'll run 'til we leave this behind Don't fall, just be who you are It's all that we need in our lives  So live like you mean it Love 'til you feel it It's all that we need in our lives  So stand on the edge with me Hold back your fear and see Nothing is real 'til it's gone  Hold on before it's too late We'll run 'til we leave this behind Don't fall, just be who you are It's all that we need in our lives  And hold on before it's too late We'll run 'til we leave this behind Don't fall, just be who you are It's all that we need in our lives It's all that we need in our lives It's all that I need in my life
I think you can do much better than me After all the lies that I made you believe And guilt kicks in and I start to see The edge of the bed where your nightgown used to be I told myself I won't miss you But I remembered what it feels like beside you I really miss your hair in my face And the way your innocence tastes  And I think you should know this You deserve much better than me While looking through your old box of notes I found those pictures I took that you were lookin' for  If there's one memory I don't want to lose That time at the mall, you and me in the dressing room I told myself I won't miss you But I remembered what it feels like beside you I really miss your hair in my face And the way your innocence tastes And I think you should know this You deserve much better than me The bed I'm layin' in is getting colder  Wish I never would've said it's over And I can't pretend I won't think about you when I'm older 'Cause we never really had our closure  This can't be the end I really miss your hair in my face And the way your innocence tastes And I think you should know this You deserve much better than me  I really miss your hair in my face And the way your innocence tastes And I think you should know this You deserve much better than me  And I think you should know this You deserve much better than me And I think you should know this You deserve much better than me And I think you should know this You deserve much better than me And I think you should know this

Driving through town just my boy and me With a happy meal in his booster seat Knowing that he couldn't have the toy Till his nuggets were gone Green traffic light turned straight to red I hit my brakes and mumbled under my breath His fries went a flying and his orange drink covered his lap Well then my four year old said a four letter word That started with "s" and I was concerned So I said son now now where did you learn to talk like that  He said I've been watching you dad, ain't that cool  I'm your buckaroo, I wanna be like you And eat all my food and grow as tall as you are We got cowboy boots and camo pants Yeah we're just alike, hey ain't we dad I wanna do everything you do So I've been watching you We got back home and I went to the barn  I bowed my head and I prayed real hard Said lord please help me help my stupid self Then this side of bedtime later that night Turning on my son's scooby doo nightlight He crawled out of bed and he got down on his knees He closed his little eyes, folded his little hands And spoke to god like he was talking to a friend And I said son now where'd you learn to pray like that He said I've been watching you dad, ain't that cool  I'm your buckaroo, I wanna be like you  And eat all my food and grow as tall as you are We like fixing things and holding mama's hand Yeah we're just alike, hey ain't we dad I wanna do everything you do So I've been watching you With tears in my eyes I wrapped him in a hug Said my little bear is growing up  He said but when I'm big I'll still know what to do  Cause I've been watching you dad, ain't that cool I'm your buckaroo, I wanna be like you And eat all my food and grow as tall as you are By then I'll be as strong as superman We'll be just alike, hey won't we dad When I can do everything you do Cause I've been watching you.
My little girl met a new friend Just the other day On the playground at school Between the tires and the swings But she came home with tear-filled eyes And she said to me "Daddy, Alyssa Lies"  Well I just brushed it off at first Cause I didn't know how much my little girl had been hurt Or the things she had seen I wasn't ready when I said you can tell me And she said  Alyssa Lies To the classroom Alyssa lies Everyday at school Alyssa lies To the teachers As she tries to cover every bruise My little girl laid her head down  That night to go to sleep As I stepped out the room I heard her say A prayer so soft and sweet  God bless my mom and my dad And my new friend Alyssa I know she needs it bad Because Alyssa lies  To the classroom  Alyssa lies Every day at school Alyssa lies To the teachers  As she tries To cover every bruise I had the worst night of sleep in years As I tried to think of a way to calm her fears I knew just what it was I had to do  But when we got to school on Monday I heard the news My little girl asked me why everybody looked so sad The lump in my throat grew bigger With every question that she asked Until I felt the tears run down my face And I told her that Alyssa wouldn't be at school today She doesn't lie  In the classroom She doesn't lie Anymore at school Alyssa lies With Jesus Because there's nothing anyone would do Tears filled my eyes When my little girl asked me why Alyssa lies Oh Daddy Daddy tell me why Alyssa lies
He's a stranger to some And a vision to none He can never get enough Get enough of the one  For a fortune, he'd quit But it's hard to admit How it ends and begins On his face is a map of the world A map of the world On his face is a map of the world A map of the world  From yesterday, it's coming From yesterday, the fear From yesterday, it calls him But he doesn't want to read the message here  On a mountain he sits, not of gold but of shit Through the blood he can look, see the lives that he took From the council of one He'll decide when he's done with the innocent  On his face is a map of the world A map of the world On his face is a map of the world A map of the world  From yesterday, it's coming From yesterday, the fear From yesterday, it calls him But he doesn't want to read the message He doesn't want to read the message He doesn't want to read the message here  On his face is a map of the world  From yesterday, it's coming From yesterday, the fear From yesterday, it calls him But he doesn't want to read the message here  From yesterday From yesterday From yesterday, the fear  From yesterday From yesterday But he doesn't want to read the message He doesn't want to read the message He doesn't want to read the message here
I should have listened to her So hard to keep control We kept on eating but Our bloated belly's still not full She gave us all she had but We went and took some more Can't seem to shut her legs Our mother nature is a whore  I got my propaganda I got revisionism I got my violence In hi-def ultra-realism All a part of this great nation I got my fist I got my plan I got survivalism  Hypnotic sound of sirens Echoing through the street The cocking of the rifles The marching of the feet You see your world on fire Don't try to act surprised We did just what you told us Lost our faith along the way and found ourselves believing your lies  I got my propaganda I got revisionism I got my violence In hi-def ultra-realism All a part of this great nation I got my fist I got my plan I got survivalism  All bruised and broken, bleeding She asked to take my hand I turned, just keep on walking But you'd do the same thing in the circumstance I'm sure you'll understand  I got my propaganda I got revisionism I got my violence In hi-def ultra-realism All a part of this great nation I got my fist I got my plan I got survivalism

"Because one day, I'll leave you a phantom To lead you in the summer To join the black parade"  (When I was a young boy My father took me into the city To see a marching band He said, "Son, when you grow up Would you be the savior of the broken The beaten and the damned?")

I got to whisper 'cause I can't be too loud  Well, my girl's in the next room Sometimes, I wish she was you I guess we never really moved on  It's really good to hear your voice saying my name It sounds so sweet Coming from the lips of an angel Hearing those words, it makes me weak And I never want to say goodbye But girl, you make it hard to be faithful With the lips of an angel  It's funny that you're calling me tonight And yes, I dreamt of you too Does he know you're talking to me?

Daddy's been a back-row Baptist With his share of front-row sin His Saturday night still on his breathe Every Sunday when he'd walk in He's never led the Benediction He's never sang in the choir But he's an angel with no halo An' one wing in the fire  Mamma lives by the Bible The Bible lives by the bed An' she's lied alone so many nights With scriptures in her head. Prayin', Good Lord, just be with him I know his Faith is tired But he's an angel with no halo An' one wing in the fire  An' I know he lives a little left of livin' right An he's come close to goin' way to far a few times But I'd trade a thousand prayers If just one prayer would come true Lord, please believe in him, like I believe in you  Daddy's always been there for me From T-Ball to touchdowns Fixed my car an' fixed my heart When they've been broken down I know he calls for more forgiveness Than most folks do require But he's an angel with no halo An' one wing in the fire  An' I know he lives a little left of livin' right An he's come close to goin' way to far a few times But I'd trade a thousand prayers If just one prayer would come true Lord, please believe in him, like I believe in you  Well, I just can't imagine What Heaven might be like If me an' Mamma make it Without Daddy by our side Lord, could you please remember When it's time to call us higher That he's an angel with no halo An' one wing in the fire Ooooh

Foals in winter coats White girls of the North Fire past one, five and one They are the fabled lambs Of Sunday ham The E.H.S. norm  And they could float above the grass In circles if they tried A latent power I know they hide To keep some hope alive That a girl like I could ever try Could ever try  So we just skirt the hallway sides A phantom and a fly Follow the lines and wonder why There's no connection  A week of rolling eyes And cheap shots from the trite And we're off to Nemarcas' porch again Another afternoon with the goat head tunes And pilfered booze  We wandered through her mama's house And the milk from the window lights Family portraits circa ninety-five This is that foreign land With the sprayed on tans And it all feels fine Be it silk or slime  So, when they tap our Monday heads To zombie walk in our stead This town seems hardly worth the time And we'll no longer memorize or rhyme Too far along in our climb Stepping over what now towers to the sky With no connection  So, when they tap our Sunday heads To zombie walk in our stead This town seems hardly worth the time And we'll no longer memorize or rhyme Too far along in our crime Stepping over what now towers to the sky With no connection

She exhales vanilla lace, I barely dreamt her, yesterday (yesterday) Read the lines in the mirror through, The lipstick trace. (Por siempre)  She said "It seems you're somewhere, far away" to his face.  (It's in the blood, It's in the blood). I met my love before I was born. (She wanted love, I taste of blood). She bit my lip, and drank my war, From years before, from years before.  Love Like Winter, oh, oh. Love Like Winter, Winter. Three, four  (It's in the blood, It's in the blood). I met my love before I was born. (He wanted love, I taste of blood). He bit my lip, and drank my war, From years before, from years before.

I never knew I never knew that everything was falling through That everyone I knew was waiting on a cue To turn and run when all I needed was the truth But that's how it's got to be It's coming down to nothing more than apathy I'd rather run the other way than stay and see The smoke and who's still standing when it clears  Everyone knows I'm in Over my head, over my head With eight seconds left in overtime She's on your mind, she's on your mind  Let's rearrange I wish you were a stranger I could disengage Just say that we agree and then never change Soften a bit until we all just get along But that's disregard Find another friend and you discard As you lose the arguments in a cable car Hanging above as the canyon comes between  Everyone knows I'm in Over my head, over my head With eight seconds left in overtime She's on your mind, she's on your mind  Everyone knows I'm in Over my head, over my head With eight seconds left in overtime She's on your mind, she's all on  And suddenly I become a part of your past I'm becoming the part that don't last I'm losing you and its effortless Without a sound we lose sight of the ground In the throw around Never thought that you wanted to bring it down I won't let it go down till we torch it ourselves  And everyone knows I'm in Over my head, over my head With eight seconds left in overtime She's on your mind, she's on your mind Everyone knows she's on your mind Everyone knows I'm in over my head I'm in over my head, I'm over my...  Everyone knows I'm in Over my head, over my head With eight seconds left in overtime She's on your mind, she's on your mind
Country Roads, old theatre marquee signs; Parkin' lots, and billboards flyin' by. Spanish mosques, little hick town squares; Wild roses on a river bank: girl its almost like you're there  Oh, every mile, a memory; every song, another scene, From some old movie going back in time you and me. Every day, a page turned down; every night, a lonesome sound, Like a freight train rollin' through my dreams: Every mile, a memory.  Red sun down, out across the western sky, Takes me back to the fire in your eyes. Texas stars in a purple night. Not seein' 'em with you baby: oh, they never do it right, no.  Every mile, a memory; every song, another scene, From some old movie going back in time you and me. Every day, a page turned down; every night, a lonesome sound, Like a freight train rollin' through my dreams: Every mile, a memory.  Funny how no matter where I run, Round every bend I only see, Just how far I haven't come.  Every mile, a memory; every song, another scene, From some old movie going back in time. Every day, a page turned down; every night, a lonesome sound, Like a freight train rollin' through my dreams: Every mile, a memory; Every mile, a memory; Every mile, a memory.
There was a man back in '95 Whose heart ran out of summers But before he died, I asked him Wait, what's the sense in life Come over me, Come over me  He said  "Son why you got to sing that tune Catch a Dylan song or some eclipse of the moon Let an angel swing and make you swoon Then you will see... You will see."  Then he said  "Here's a riddle for yah Find the Answer There's a reason for the world You and I..."  Picked up my kid from school today Did you learn anything 'cause in the world today You can't live in a castle far away Now talk to me, come talk to me  He said  "Dad I'm big but we're smaller than small In the scheme of things, well we're nothing at all Still every mother's child sings a lonely song So play with me, come play with me  And Hey Dad Here's a riddle for yah Find the Answer There's a reason for the world You and I..."  I said  "Son for all I've told yah When you get right down to the Reason for the world... Who am I?"  There are secrets that we still have left to find There have been mysteries from the beginning of time There are answers we're not wise enough to see  He said... "You looking for a clue I Love You free..." The batter swings and the summer flies As I look into my angel's eyes A song plays on while the moon is high over me Something comes over me I guess we're big and I guess we're small If you think about it man you know we got it all Cause we're all we got on this bouncing ball And I love you free I love you freely Here's a riddle for yah Find the Answer There's a reason for the world You and I...

Would you go with me if we rolled down streets of fire Would you hold on to me tighter as the summer sun got higher If we roll from town to town and never shut it down  Would you go with me if we were lost in fields of clover Would we walk even closer until the trip was over And would it be okay if I didn't know the way  If I gave you my hand would you take it And make me the happiest man in the world If I told you my heart couldn't beat one more minute without you, girl Would you accompany me to the edge of the sea Let me know if you're really a dream I love you so, so would you go with me  Would you go with me if we rode the clouds together Could you not look down forever If you were lighter than a feather Oh, and if I set you free, would you go with me  If I gave you my hand would you take it And make me the happiest man in the world If I told you my heart couldn't beat one more minute without you, girl Would you accompany me to the edge of the sea Help me tie up the ends of a dream I gotta know, would you go with me I love you so, so would you go with me

I don't love him, winter just wasn't my season  Yeah we walk through the doors, so accusing their eyes Like they have any right at all to criticize Hypocrites, you're all here for the very same reason  And 'cause you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable And life's like an hourglass, glued to the table No one can find the rewind button, girl So cradle your head in your hands  And breathe, just breathe Oh breathe, just breathe  In May he turned 21 on the base at Fort Bliss Just a Day, he said down to the flask in his fist Ain't been sober, since maybe October of last year  Here in town you can tell he's been down for awhile But, my God, it's so beautiful when the boy smiles Wanna hold him, maybe I'll just sing about it  'Cause you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable And life's like an hourglass, glued to the table No one can find the rewind button, boys So cradle your head in your hands  And breathe, just breathe Oh breathe, just breathe  There's a light at each end of this tunnel You shout 'cause you're just as far in as you'll ever be out And these mistakes you've made, you'll just make them again If you only try turning around  2 AM and I'm still awake, writing a song If I get it all down on paper, it's no longer Inside of me threatening the life it belongs to  And I feel like I'm naked in front of the crowd 'Cause these words are my diary, screaming out loud And I know that you'll use them however you want to  But you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable And life's like an hourglass, glued to the table No one can find the rewind button now Sing it if you understand  And breathe, just breathe Whoa breathe, just breathe Oh breathe, just breathe Oh breathe, just breathe

Life ain't always beautiful Sometimes it's just plain hard Life can knock you down, it can break your heart  Life ain't always beautiful You think you're on your way And it's just a dead end road at the end of the day  But the struggles makes you stronger And the changes make you wise And happiness has its own way of takin' its sweet time  No, life ain't always beautiful Tears will fall sometimes Life ain't always beautiful, but it's a beautiful ride  Life ain't always beautiful Some days I miss your smile I get tired of walkin' all these lonely miles  And I wish for just one minute I could see your pretty face Guess I can dream, but life don't work that way  But the struggles makes me stronger And the changes make me wise And happiness has its own way of takin' its sweet time  No, life ain't always beautiful But I know I'll be fine Hey, life ain't always beautiful, but its a beautiful ride What a beautiful ride
Fin'lly got over that song of ours; stopped chasin' little red sports cars, To check the license plates an' back wood drivin' by your place. Back makin' the rounds at our old haunts: Honky Tonks, restaurants. An' seein' some of our old friends: it feels good to dance again. An' I can fin'lly smell your perfume an' not look around the room for you. An' I can walk right by your picture in a frame an' not feel a thing.  But when I hear your name, I feel rain fallin' right out of the blue sky. An' it's the fifth of May, an' I'm right there starin' in your eyes. An' nothin's changed, an' we're still same. An' I get lost in the innocence of a first kiss, An' I'm hangin' on to every word rollin' off of your lips: An' that's all it takes, an' I'm in that place, Every time I hear your name.  Got someone special in my life: everyone thinks she'd make a great wife. Dad says he thinks she's the one: reminds him of Mom when she was young, But it's way too soon to be talkin 'bout rings; don't wanna rush into anything. She's getting over someone too, kinda like me an' you. An' she talks about him every once in a while, an' I just nod my head an' smile, 'Cause I know exactly what she's goin' through: yeah, I've been there too.  An' when the conversation turns to you, I get caught in a "you were the only one for me", Kinda thought, an' your face is all that I see. I know I can't go back but I still go back. An' there we are, a point down by the riverside, An' I'm in your arms about to make love for the first time, An' that's all it takes, an' I'm in that place, Every time I hear your name.  So I'm thinkin' 'bout the words I left unsaid. (Every time I hear your name.) Stop tryin' the change the things I can't change. (Every time I hear your name.) In my heart I know you're gone, but in my head,  I feel rain fallin' right out of the blue sky. An' it's the fifth of May, an' I'm right there starin' in your eyes. That's all it takes, an' I'm in that place. An' there we are, a point down by the riverside, An' I'm in your arms about to make love for the first time. An' I can't explain, but I'm in that place, Every time I hear your name. Every time I hear your name. (Every time I hear your name.) Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. (Every time I hear your name.) Ah ah. Every time I hear your name.

Like a grain on the beach Like a star in the sky Far too many to count with the naked eye They won't see you  Go ahead Walk on by You don't know I'm alive Maybe one day you'll find You should open your eyes You don't know me  You're the one who looked right through me Now you're saying that you knew me When I was invisible And you're the one who walked right through me Now you're saying that you knew me When I was invisible  Little things adding up Try so hard not to rush Giving in, letting go of the world we know They won't see you  Force it down Lose the taste They all think it's a waste We don't need to believe every word they say, no They don't know me  You're the one who looked right through me Now you're saying that you knew me When I was invisible And you're the one who walked right through me Now you're saying that you knew me When I was invisible  It's so easy to be lost But maybe you're not lost at all  Do you recognize me? Do you know who I am? Do you see me now? Do you see me now?  You're the one who looked right through me Now you're saying that you knew me When I was invisible And you're the one who walked right through me Now you're saying that you knew me When I was invisible I'm invisible I'm invisible
I've been your lover, I've been your friend I've been your faithful one-woman man I've been your diamond in the rough Now you say you wanna polish me up  [Chorus] Why, why, why do you wanna change me now? Ain't I the one you loved everything about? You might start missin' the old me around So why, why, why do you wanna change me now  I remember you used to like Walkin' with me on my wilder side My kind of crazy turned you on Do you really want that part of me gone?  [Chorus] Why, why, why do you wanna change me now? Ain't I the one you loved everything about? You might start missin' the old me around So why, why, why do you wanna change me now  Why, why, why Ain't I the one? You might start missin'  [Chorus] Why, why, why do you wanna change me now? Ain't I the one you loved everything about? You might start missin' the old me around So why, why, why do you wanna change me now
I just left Bobby's house: The service was today. Got me thinkin' about how fragile life is, As I drove away. You know Amy was his only love, In a moment she was gone, long gone: It could have been me or you. Oh, baby, there's no time to lose.  So I'm gonna bring home a dozen roses, An' pour us a glass of wine. An' I'm gonna put on a little music, An' turn down the lights. An' I'm gonna wrap my arms around you, An' rock you all through the night, An' I'm gonna love you, Like it's the last day of my life.  I drive off when the sun comes up: I get back when it's gone down. There's so much I wanna do with you, But I can't be around. Whoa, time has been just like a thief, It's stolen too much from us, So once it's gone we can't make it up. So tonight, let's get back in touch.    I'm gonna bring home a dozen roses, An' pour us a glass of wine. An' I'm gonna put on a little music, An' turn down the lights. An' I'm gonna wrap my arms around you, An' rock you all through the night, An' I'm gonna love you, Like it's the last day of my...  Life is a rainbow, it's a spring snow, It's the mornin' dew. An' I don't wanna waste another minute, Without you.  So I'm gonna bring home a dozen roses, An' pour us a glass of wine. An' I'm gonna put on a little music, An' turn down the lights. An' I'm gonna wrap my arms around you, An' rock you all through the night, An' I'm gonna love you, Like it's the last day of my life. I'm gonna love you, Like it's the last day of my life. Oh, oh.
Keep holding on when my brain's ticking like a bomb Guess the black thoughts have come again to get me Sweet bitter words unlike nothing I have heard Sing along, mockingbird, you don't affect me  That's right Deliver it to my heart Please strike Be deliberate  Wait, I'm coming undone Irate, I'm coming undone Too late, I'm coming undone What looks so strong, so delicate  Wait, I'm starting to suffocate And soon I anticipate I'm coming undone What looks so strong, so delicate  Choke, choke again, I thought my demons were my friends Pity me in the end, they're out to get me Since I was young I tasted sorrow on my tongue And this sweet sugar gun does not protect me  That's right Trigger between my eyes Please strike Make it quick now  Wait, I'm coming undone Irate, I'm coming undone Too late, I'm coming undone What looks so strong, so delicate  Wait, I'm starting to suffocate And soon I anticipate I'm coming undone What looks so strong, so delicate I'm trying to hold it together head is lighter than a feather looks like I'm not getting better not getting better Wait, I'm coming undone Irate, I'm coming undone Too late, I'm coming undone What looks so strong, so delicate Wait, I'm starting to suffocate And soon I anticipate I'm coming undone What looks so strong, so delicate

You keep running for another place To find that saving grace  Don't you baby?  You keep running for another place To find that saving grace  Don't you baby?

Beautiful dawn - lights up the shore for me. There is nothing else in the world, I'd rather wake up and see (with you). Beautiful dawn - I'm just chasing time again. Thought I would die a lonely man, in endless night. But now I'm high; running wild among all the stars above. Sometimes it's hard to believe you remember me.  Beautiful dawn - melt with the stars again. Do you remember the day when my journey began? Will you remember the end (of time)? Beautiful dawn - You're just blowing my mind again. Thought I was born to endless night, until you shine. High; running wild among all the stars above. Sometimes it's hard to believe you remember me.  Will you be my shoulder when I'm grey and older? Promise me tomorrow starts with you, Getting high; running wild among all the stars above. Sometimes it's hard to believe you remember me

I felt the earth on Monday, it moved beneath my feet In the form of a morning paper, laid out for me to see Saw his face in a color picture, I recognized the name Could not stop staring at the... face I'd never see again  It's a shame to awake in a world of pain What does it mean when the war is taking over? It's the same every day I heard my name Why can't they say that the world be left to hold her?  The whole world, world over It's a World Wide Suicide The whole world, world over It's a World Wide Suicide  Medals on a wooden mantle, next to a handsome face That the President took for granted... Writing checks that others pay And in all the madness, thought becomes numb and naive  So much to talk about, and nothing for us to say It's the same every day a wave won't break Tell you to pray while the devil's on his shoulder Laying claims to the tainted soldier said  I'm not a quitting, the truth's already out there The whole world, world over It's a World Wide Suicide The whole world, world over  It's a World Wide Suicide (Guitar)  Looking in the eyes of the fallen You've got to know there's another, another, another, another, another... Way! It's a shame to awake in a world of pain  What does it mean when the war is taking over? It's the same every day, a wave won't break Tell you to pray while the devil's on his shoulder The whole world, world over It's a World Wide Suicide The whole world, world over It's a World Wide Suicide The whole world, world over It's a World Wide Suicide The whole world, world over It's a World Wide Suicide!!!

My yesterdays are all boxed up and neatly put away But every now and then you come to mind Cause you were always waiting to be picked to play the game But when your name was called, you found a place to hide When you knew that I was always on your side  Well everything was easy then, so sweet and innocent But my demons and my angels reappeared Leavin' all the traces of the man you thought I���d be Too afraid to hear the words I had always feared  Leavin' you with all these questions all these years  But is there someplace far away, someplace where all is clear Easy to start over with the ones you hold so dear Or are you left to wonder, all alone, eternally This isn't how it's really meant to be No it isn't how it's really meant to be  Well they say that love is in the air, but never is it clear, How to pull it close and make it stay Butterflies are free to fly, and so they fly away And I'm left to carry on and wonder why Even through it all, I'm always on your side  But is there someplace far away, someplace where all is clear Easy to start over with the ones you hold so dear Or are you left to wonder, all alone, eternally But is this how it's really meant to be No is it how it's really meant to be  Well if they say that love is in the air, never is it clear How to pull it close and make it stay If butterflies are free to fly, why do they fly away Leavin' me to carry on and wonder why Was it you that kept me wondering through this life When you know that I was always on your side

Did I disappoint you or let you down? Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown? 'Cause I saw the end before we'd begun Yes I saw you were blind and I knew I had won.

You changed my life and all my goals. And love is blind and that I knew when My heart was blinded by you. I've kissed your lips and held your head. Shared your dreams and shared your bed. I know you well, I know your smell. I've been addicted to you. Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend. You have been the one. You have been the one for me. Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend.

And as you move on, remember me Remember us and all we used to be I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile. I've watched you sleeping for a while. I'd be the father of your child. I'd spend a lifetime with you. I know your fears and you know mine. We've had our doubts but now we're fine And I love you, I swear that's true. I cannot live without you. Goodbye my lover.

I watched the proverbial sunrise Coming up over the Pacific and You might think I'm losing my mind, But I will shy away from the specifics...  'cause I don't want you to know where I am 'cause then you'll see my heart In the saddest state it's ever been.  This is no place to try and live my life.  Stop right there. That's exactly where I lost it. See that line. Well I never should have crossed it. Stop right there. Well I never should have said That it's the very moment that I wish that I could take back.   I'm sorry for the person I became. I'm sorry that it took so long for me to change. I'm ready to be sure I never become that way again 'cause who I am hates who I've been. Who I am hates who I've been.  I talk to absolutely no one. Couldn't keep to myself enough. And the things bottled inside have finally begun To create so much pressure that I'll soon blow up.  I heard the reverberating footsteps Synching up to the beating of my heart, And I was positive that unless I got myself together, I would watch me fall apart.  And I can't let that happen again 'cause then you'll see my heart In the saddest state it's ever been.  This is no place to try and live my life.    Who I am hates who I've been And who I am will take the second chance you gave me. Who I am hates who I've been 'cause who I've been only ever made me...  So sorry for the person I became. So sorry that it took so long for me to change. I'm ready to be sure I never become that way again 'cause who I am hates who I've been. Who I am hates who I've been.
I feel no shame I'm proud of where I came from I was born and raised in the boondocks  One thing I know No matter where I go I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks  And I can feel That muddy water running through my veins And I can hear that lullaby of a midnight train And it sings to me and it sounds familiar  I feel no shame I'm proud of where I came from I was born and raised in the boondocks  One thing I know No matter where I go I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks  And I can taste That honeysuckle and it's still so sweet When it grows wild On the banks down at old camp creek Yeah, and it calls to me like a warm wind blowing  I feel no shame I'm proud of where I came from I was born and raised in the boondocks  One thing I know No matter where I go I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks  It's where I learned about living It's where I learned about love It's where I learned about working hard And having a little was just enough  It's where I learned about Jesus And knowing where I stand You can take it or leave it This is me, this is who I am  Give me a tin roof A front porch and a gravel road And that's home to me It feels like home to me  I feel no shame I'm proud of where I came from I was born and raised in the boondocks  One thing I know No matter where I go I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks  You get a line, I get a pole We'll go fishing in the crawfish hole Five card poker on Saturday night Church on Sunday morning  You get a line, I get a pole (You get a line, I get a pole) We'll go fishing (We'll go fishing in the crawfish hole) Down in the boondocks (Five card poker on Saturday night) Church on Sunday morning  You get a line, I get a pole (You get a line, I get a pole) We'll go fishing (We'll go fishing in the crawfish hole) Down in the boondocks (Five card poker on Saturday night) (Say a little prayer for me) Church on Sunday morning You get a line, I get a pole (You get a line, I get a pole) We'll go fishing (We'll go fishing in the crawfish hole) Down in the boondocks (Five card poker on Saturday night) (Say a little prayer for me) Church on Sunday morning  Sing "I get a line" etc. 3 times more

Cowboys Are Frequently Secretly (Fond of Each Other)  Well, there's many a strange impulse out on the plains of West Texas. There's many a young boy who feels things he can't comprehend. And a small town don't like it when somebody falls between sexes. No, a small town don't like it when a cowboy has feelings for men.  And I believe to my soul that inside every man there's the feminine. And inside every lady there's a deep manly voice loud and clear. Well, a cowboy may brag about things that he's done with his women. But the ones who brag loudest are the ones that are most likely queer.  Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other. Say, what do you think all them saddles and boots was about? And there's many a cowboy who don't understand the way that he feels for his brother. And inside every cowboy there's a lady that'd love to slip out.  And there's always somebody who says what the others just whisper. And mostly that someone's the first one to get shot down dead. So when you talk to a cowboy don't treat him like he was a sister. You can't f**k with a lady that's sleepin' in each cowboy's head.  Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other. What did you think all them saddles and boots was about? And there's many a cowboy who don't understand the way that he feels for his brother. And inside every lady there's a cowboy who wants to come out. And inside every cowboy there's a lady that'd love to slip out.

And you ask me what I want this year And I try to make this kind and clear Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days 'Cause I don't need boxes wrapped in strings And desire and love and empty things Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days  So take these words And sing out loud 'Cause everyone is forgiven now 'Cause tonight's the night the world begins again I need someplace simple where we could live  And something only you can give And thats faith and trust and peace while we're alive And the one poor child that saved this world And there's 10 million more who probably could If we all just stopped and said a prayer for them So take these words  And sing out loud 'Cause everyone is forgiven now 'Cause tonight's the night the world begins again I wish everyone was loved tonight And somehow stop this endless fight  Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days So take these words And sing out loud 'Cause everyone is forgiven now 'Cause tonight's the night the world begins again 'Cause tonight's the night the world begins again

He who makes a beast out of himself, gets rid of the pain of being a man  Caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay. I tried to drive all through the night, The heat stroke ridden weather, the barren empty sights. No oasis here to see, the sand is singing deathless words to me.  Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn (all alone). Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attraction. My confidence is leaving me on my own (all alone). No one can save me and you know I don't want the attention.  As I adjust to my new sights the rarely tired lights will take me to new heights. My hand is on the trigger I'm ready to ignite. Tomorrow might not make it but everything's all right. Mental fiction, follow me; show me what it's like to be set free.  Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn (all alone). Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attraction. My confidence is leaving me on my own (all alone). No one can save me and you know I don't want the attention.  So sorry you're not here I've been chained too long my vision's so unclear. Now take a trip with me but don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem.  Caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay. These eyes won't see the same, after I flip today.  Sometimes I don't know why we'd rather live than die, We look up towards the sky for answers to our lives. We may get some solutions but most just pass us by, Don't want your absolution cause I can't make it right. I'll make a beast out of myself, gets rid of all the pain of being a man.  Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn (all alone). Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attraction. My confidence is leaving me on my own (all alone). No one can save me and you know I don't want the attention.  So sorry you're not here I've been sane too long my vision's so unclear. Now take a trip with me but don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem. I've known it from the start all these good ideas will tear your brain apart. Scared but you can follow me I'm too weird to live but much too rare to die.

I want to live where soul meets body And let the sun wrap its arms around me and Bathe my skin in water cool and cleansing And feel- feel what it's like to be new  'Cause in my head, there's a Greyhound station Where I send my thoughts, to far-off destinations So they may have a chance, of finding a place where they're Far more suited than here  I cannot guess what we'll discover When we turn the dirt, with our palms cupped like shovels But I know our filthy hands, can wash one another's And not one speck will remain  I do believe it's true, that there are roads left in both of our shoes But if the silence takes you, then I hope it takes me too So brown eyes I'll hold you near, 'cause you're the only song I want to hear A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere  Where a soul meets body Where a soul meets body Where a soul meets body  And I do believe it's true, that there are roads left in both of our shoes But if the silence takes you, then I hope it takes me too So brown eyes, I'll hold you near, 'cause you're the only song I want to hear A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere  A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere
We belong together like the open seas and shores wedded by the planet force we've all been spoken for  The hammer may strike, be dead on the ground. a net to my hand, a cross on his crown. we're done if, who we're undone, finished if who we are incomplete. as one we are everything, we are everything we need.  we belong together like the open seas and shores wedded by the planet force we've all been spoken for  What good is a life, With no one to share, The light of the moon, The honor of a swear? The kingdom of men, Is hollow within, Without depth, Without the care, That it takes to make a perfect love, The passion to find the other truth, To visualize the straightened from the skewed, To trade a common comfort for a view, Would you try to live the way in which you speak? Taste the milk of your mother earth's love? Spread the word of consciousness you seek? We are everything we need  We belong together like the open seas and shores wedded by the planet force we've all been spoken for  All this indecision all this independent strength still we've got our hearts on safe we've got our hearts on safe  Someday when you're lonely, sometime after all this bliss, somewhere lost in emptiness, I hope you find this gift... I hope you find this gift. I hope you find this gift.

Summer has come and passed The innocent can never last Wake me up when September ends  Like my father's come to pass Seven years has gone so fast Wake me up when September ends  Here comes the rain again Falling from the stars Drenched in my pain again Becoming who we are  As my memory rests But never forgets what I lost Wake me up when September ends  Summer has come and passed The innocent can never last Wake me up when September ends  Ring out the bells again Like we did when spring began Wake me up when September ends  Here comes the rain again Falling from the stars Drenched in my pain again Becoming who we are  As my memory rests But never forgets what I lost Wake me up when September ends  Summer has come and passed The innocent can never last Wake me up when September ends  Like my father's come to pass Twenty years has gone so fast Wake me up when September ends  Wake me up when September ends Wake me up when September ends.

Oh, you know I did it It's over and I feel fine Nothing you can say is gonna change my mind Waited, and I waited the longest night Nothing like the taste of sweet decline  I went down, I fell, I fell so fast Dropping like the grains in an hourglass Never say forever, 'cause nothing lasts Dancing with the bones of my buried past  Nevermind, there's nothing I can do Bet your life there's something killing you  It's a shame we have to die, my dear No one's getting out of here alive This time What a way to go, but have no fear No one's getting out of here alive This time  I'm finished I'm getting you off my chest Made you come clean in a dirty dress A promise is a promise You're kept in check Hard to cross a heart that beats its best  Take a good hard look for the very last time The very last one in a very long line Only took a second to say goodbye Been a pleasure, but the pleasure's been mine all Mine  Nevermind, there's nothing I can do Bet your life there's something killing you  It's a shame we have to die, my dear No one's getting out of here alive This time What a way to go, but have no fear No one's getting out of here alive This time  Ain't no way, D.O.A. Ain't no way, D.O.A.  Take a good hard look for the very last time The very last one in a very long line Only took a second to say goodbye Been a pleasure, but the pleasure's been mine all Mine  Nevermind, there's nothing I can do Bet your life there's something killing you  It's a shame we have to die, my dear No one's getting out of here alive This time What a way to go, but have no fear No one's getting out of here alive This time It's a shame we have to disappear No one's getting out of here alive This time, this time, this time
I've got a candle And I've got a spoon I live in a hallway with no doors and no rooms Under the window sill they all were found A touch of concrete within a doorway Without a sound  Someone save me if you will And take away all these pills And please just save me, if you can From the blasphemy in my wasteland  How did I get here And what went wrong Couldn't handle forgiveness Now I'm far beyond gone And I can hardly remember the look of my own eyes How could I love this My life's so dishonest It made me compromise  Someone save me if you will And take away all these pills And please just save me, if you can From the blasphemy in my wasteland  Jump in the water Jump in with me Jump on the altar Lay down with me My hardest question to answer is why  Someone save me if you will And take away all these pills And please just save me, if you can From the blasphemy in my wasteland  Some one save me Some one save me Somebody save me Somebody save me Please don't erase me
Sarabeth is scared to death To hear what the doctor will say She hasn't been well, since the day that she fell And the bruise, it just won't go away  So she sits and she waits with her mother and dad And flips through an old magazine Till the nurse with the smile stands in the door And says "Will you please come with me?"  Sarabeth is scared to death 'cause the doctor just told her the news "Between the red cells and white, something's not right But we're gonna take care of you  Six chances in ten, it won't come back again With the therapy we're gonna try It's just been approved, it's the strongest there is And I think that we caught it in time." And Sarabeth closes her eyes.  And she dreams she's dancing Around and around without any cares And her very first love is holding her close And a soft wind is blowing her hair  Sarabeth is scared to death As she sits holding her mom 'cause it would be a mistake for someone to take A girl with no hair to the prom  For just this morning, right here on her pillow Was the cruelest of any surprise And she cried when she gathered it all in her hands The proof that she couldn't deny And Sarabeth closes her eyes  And she dreams she's dancing Around and around without any cares And her very first love is holding her close And a soft wind is blowing her hair  It's quarter to seven, that boy's at the door And her daddy ushers him in And when he takes off his cap They all start to cry 'cause this morning where his hair had all been Softly she touches just skin  And they go dancing, around and around Without any cares And her very first true love is holding her close And for a moment she isn't scared

Written by Kip Raines and Jeffrey Steele  Well, Grandaddy was a hillbilly scholar, blue collar of a man. He came from the school where you didn't need nothin', If you couldn't make it with your own two hands. He was backwoods, backwards, used words like: "No Sir," "Yes, Ma'am," "By God," "Be darned," "Hell yeah, I'm American." In all the years he walked this earth, I swear all he did was work. He said: "The devil dreams on an idle horse, "So you listen to me squirt.  "Don't get too high on the bottle, And get right with the Man. Fight your fights, find a grace, And all the things that you can change, And help somebody if you can."  Now Granny said: "Sonny, stick to your ganas, If you believe in something, no matter what, 'Cause it's better to be hated for who you are, Than be loved for who you're not." She was five feet of concrete New York born an' raised on a slick city street. She'd cold-stare you down, stand her ground, Still kickin' and screamin' at 93. I remember just how frail she looked in that hospital bed: Takin' her last few breaths of life, smilin' as she said:  "Don't get too high on the bottle, Just a little sip ev'ry now and then.

Wind me up Put me down Start me off and watch me go I'll be runnin' circles around you sooner than you know A little off center And I'm out of tune  Just kickin' this can along the avenue But I'm alright Cause it's easy once you know how it's done You can't stop now It's already begun  You feel it runnin' through your bones And you jerk it out And you jerk it out Shut up Hush your mouth Can't you hear you talk too loud?  No can't hear nothin' 'cause I got my head up in the clouds I bite off anything that I can chew I'm chasing cars up and down the avenue But that's ok  Cause it's easy once you know how it's done You can't stop now It's already begun You feel it runnin' through your bones  And you jerk it out Cause it's easy once you know how it's done You can't stop now It's already begun You feel it runnin' through your bones And you jerk it out And you jerk it out And you jerk it out And you jerk it out Oh baby don't you know you Really gotta jerk it out When you jerk it out Oh baby don't you know you Really gotta jerk it out When you jerk it out Oh baby don't you know you Really gotta jerk it out
I don't need to be anything other Than a prison guard's son I don't need to be anything other Than a specialist's son I don't have to be anyone other Than the birth of two souls in one Part of where I'm going, is knowing where I'm coming from  I don't want to be Anything other than what I've been trying to be lately All I have to do Is think of me and I have peace of mind I'm tired of looking 'round rooms Wondering what I've got to do Or who I'm supposed to be  I don't want to be anything other than me  I'm surrounded by liars Everywhere I turn I'm surrounded by imposters Everywhere I turn I'm surrounded by identity crisis  Everywhere I turn Am I the only one who noticed? I can't be the only one who's learned  I don't want to be Anything other than what I've been trying to be lately All I have to do Is think of me and I have peace of mind I'm tired of looking 'round rooms  Wondering what I've got to do Or who I'm supposed to be I don't want to be anything other than me  Can I have everyone's attention please? If you're not like this and that, you're gonna have to leave  I came from the mountain The crust of creation My whole situation-made from clay to stone And now I'm telling everybody  I don't want to be Anything other than what I've been trying to be lately All I have to do Is think of me and I have peace of mind I'm tired of looking 'round rooms Wondering what I've got to do Or who I'm supposed to be I don't want to be anything other than me I don't want to be I don't want to be I don't want to be...
I set out on a narrow way, many years ago Hopin' I would find true love along the broken road But I got lost a time or two Wiped my brow and kept pushin' through I couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to you  Every long lost dream led me to where you are Others who broke my heart, they were like northern stars Pointing me on my way into your loving arms This much I know is true That God blessed the broken road That led me straight to you (Yes He did)  I think about the years I spent, Just passin' through I'd like to have the time I lost, and give it back to you But you just smile and take my hand You've been there, you understand It's all part of a grander plan that is comin' true  That every long lost dream led me to where you are Others who broke my heart, they were like northern stars Pointing me on my way into your loving arms This much I know is true That God blessed the broken road That led me straight to you ou ou Yaa yaa ya  But now I'm just a rollin' home into my lover's arms This much I know is true That God blessed the broken road That led me straight to you That God blessed the broken road That led me straight to you
I walked across an empty land I knew the pathway like the back of my hand I felt the earth beneath my feet Sat by the river and it made me complete  Oh simple thing where have you gone? I'm getting old and I need something to rely on So tell me when you're gonna let me in I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin  I came across a fallen tree I felt the branches of it looking at me Is this the place we used to love? Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?  Oh simple thing where have you gone? I'm getting old and I need something to rely on So tell me when you're gonna let me in I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin  And if you have a minute why don't we go Talk about it somewhere only we know? This could be the end of everything So why don't we go? Somewhere only we know? Somewhere only we know?  Oh simple thing where have you gone? I'm getting old and I need something to rely on So tell me when you're gonna let me in I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin  And if you have a minute why don't we go? Talk about it somewhere only we know This could be the end of everything So why don't we go? So why don't we go? This could be the end of everything So why don't we go? Somewhere only we know Somewhere only we know Somewhere only we know
It was just another story printed on the second page Underneath the Tiger's football score It said he was only eighteen, a boy about my age They found him face down on his bedroom floor  There'll be services on Friday at the Lawrence Funeral Home Then out on Mooresville highway, they'll lay him 'neath a stone...  How do you get that lonely, how do you hurt that bad To make you make the call, that havin' no life at all Is better than the life that you had How do you feel so empty, you want to let it all go How do you get that lonely... and nobody knows  Did his girlfriend break up with him, did he buy or steal that gun? Did he lose a fight with drugs or alcohol? Did his Mom and Daddy forget to say I love you son? Did no one see the writing on the wall? I'm not blamin' anybody, we all do the best we can I know hindsight's 20u002F20, but I still don't understand...  How do you get that lonely, how do you hurt that bad To make you make the call, that havin' no life at all Is better than the life that you had How do you feel so empty, you want to let it all go How do you get that lonely... and nobody knows It was just another story printed on the second page Underneath the Tiger's football score...
Tough, You think you've got the stuff, You're telling me and everyone You're hard enough.  You don't have to put up a fight, You don't have to always be right, Let me take some of the punches For you tonight.  Listen to me now, I need to let you know, You don't have to go it along.  And it's you when I look in the mirror, And it's you when I don't pick up the phone. Sometimes you can't make it on your own.  We fight all the time, You and I, that's alright, We're the same soul.  I don't need, I don't need to hear you say That if we weren't so alike You'd like me a whole lot more.  Listen to me now, I need to let you know, You don't have to go it alone.  And it's you when I look in the mirror, And it's you when I don't pick up the phone. Sometimes you can't make it on your own.  I know that we don't talk, In sick of it all. Can you hear me when I sing? You're the reason I sing, You're the reason why the opera is in me. Where are we now, Still got to let you know, A house doesn't make a home, Don't leave me here alone. And it's you when I look in the mirror, And it's you when I don't pick up the phone. Sometimes you can't make it on your own, Sometimes you can't make it... The best you can do is to fake it. Sometimes you can't make it on your own

On behalf of every man Looking out for every girl You are the guide and the weight of her world  So fathers be good to your daughters Daughters will love like you do Girls become lovers who turn into mothers So mothers be good to your daughters, too So mothers be good to your daughters, too So mothers be good to your daughters, too

I can remember when you fit in the palm of my hand. You felt so good in it; no bigger than a minute. How it amazes me you're changin' with every blink. Faster than a flower blooms, they grow up all too soon.  So let them be little, 'Cause they're only that way for a while. Give 'em hope, give them praise, Give them love every day. Let 'em cry, let 'em giggle, Let 'em sleep in the middle, Oh, but let them be little.  I never felt so much in one little tender touch. I live for those kisses, your prayers an' your wishes. An' now you're teachin' me how only a child can see. Tonight, while we're on our knees, all I ask is:  Please, let them be little, 'Cause they're only that way for a while. Give them hope, give them praise, Give them love every day. Let 'em cry, let 'em giggle, Let 'em sleep in the middle, Oh, but let them be little.  The so innocent, precious soul: You turn around, an' it's time to let them go.  So let them be little, 'Cause they're only that way for a while. Give them hope, give 'em praise, Give them love every day. Let 'em cry, let 'em giggle, Let them sleep in the middle, Oh, but let them be little.  Let them be little.

I woke up early with a poundin' in my head I'd been out the night before with all my friends A little worried, kinda wonderin' what I did I said, " Lord, please forgive me for my sins." My wife wanted to kill me, but she tried to save me first "You're goin' if I have to drag your butt to church."  I love this crazy, tragic, Sometimes almost magic, Awful, beautiful life  I read the hymns and kinda sorta sang along And made it through the Sunday sermon wide awake We met the family for dinner at our home Drank some beer, watched a game, and cooked some steaks My little brother had a big fight with his wife And my poor mother sat between'em both all night  I love this crazy, tragic, Sometimes almost magic, Awful, beautiful life  We said a prayer for Cousin Michael in Iraq We're all aware that he may never make it back We talked about the way we missed his stupid jokes And how he loved to be a soldier more than most  I laid in bed that night and thought about the day And how my life is like a roller coaster ride The ups and downs and crazy turns along the way It'll throw you off if you don't hold on tight You can't really smile until you've shed some tears I could die today or I might live on for years  I love this crazy, tragic, Sometimes almost magic, Awful, beautiful life  I love this crazy, tragic, Sometimes almost magic, Awful, beautiful life  Alright It's a beautiful life Awful, beautiful, life I love this life It's a beautiful life
He's got fasting black lungs Made of clove-splintered shards They're the kind that will talk Through a wheezing of coughs And I hear him every night In every pore And every time he just makes me warm  Freeze without an answer Free from all the shame Must I hide 'Cause I'll never, never sleep alone  Look at how they flock to him From an isle of open sores He knows that the taste is such Is such to die for And I hear him every night On every street The scales that do slither Deliver me from...  Freeze without an answer Free from all the shame Then I'll hide 'Cause I'll never, never sleep alone Oh Lord  Said I'm, said I'm, said I'm, Said I'm bloodshot for sure Pale runs the ghost Swollen on the shore  Every night In every pore The scales that do slither Deliver me from...  Freeze without an answer Free from all the shame Then I'll hide 'Cause I'll never, never sleep alone  Freeze without an answer Free from all the shame Let me die 'Cause I'll never, never sleep alone
I'm no Barbie doll I'm not your baby girl I've done ugly things And I have made mistakes And I am not as pretty as those girls in magazines I am rotten to my core if they're to be believed  So what if I'm no baby bird hanging upon your every word Nothing ever smells of roses that rises out of mud  Why do you love me?

Like a cloud full of rain shouldn't hang in the sky Ice shouldn't burn or a bumblebee fly If you feel so happy, then why do you cry? Oh nothin' 'bout love makes sense  Like an ocean liner shouldn't float on the sea A pearl in an oyster or a circus of fleas Someone so perfect can't be fallin' for me Oh nothin' 'bout love makes sense  Nothin' 'bout love is less than confusing You can win when you're losing Stand when you're fallin' I can't figure it out Nothin' 'bout love can make an equation Nothin' short of amazin' Wish I could explain it But I don't know how  The way that we dance, the reason we dream, That big Italian tower, well how does it lean? Somethin' so strong shouldn't make me this weak Oh nothin' 'bout love makes sense ... Nothin' 'bout love is less than confusing You can win when you're losing Stand when you're fallin' I can't figure it out Nothin' 'bout love can make an equation Nothin' short of amazin' Wish I could explain it But I don't know how  Like the lights of Las Vegas glowin' out of the sand A jumbo shrimp or a baby grand How you touched my heart while you're holdin' my hand Oh nothin' 'bout love makes sense  Oh nothin' 'bout love makes sense Oh nothin' 'bout love makes sense Ooooooo no no no Oh, it don't make sense
Well, if you wanted honesty That's all you had to say I never want to let you down Or have you go, it's better off this way For all the dirty looks The photographs your boyfriend took Remember when you broke your foot From jumping out the second floor?  I'm not okay I'm not okay I'm not okay You wear me out  What will it take to show you That it's not the life it seems? (I'm not okay) I've told you time and time again You sing the words but don't know what it means (I'm not okay) To be a joke and look Another line without a hook I held you close as we both shook For the last time, take a good hard look  I'm not okay I'm not okay I'm not okay You wear me out  Forget about the dirty looks The photographs your boyfriend took You said you read me like a book But the pages all are torn and frayed  I'm okay I'm okay I'm okay now (I'm okay now) But you really need to listen to me Because I'm telling you the truth I mean this, I'm okay! (Trust me)  I'm not okay I'm not okay Well, I'm not okay I'm not o-fucking-kay I'm not okay I'm not okay
Driving down the interstate Running 30 minutes late Singing 'Margaritaville' and minding my own Some foreign car driving dude With a road rage attitude Pulled up beside me talking on his cell phone.  He started yelling at me Like I did something wrong He flipped me the bird And then he was gone.  Some beach somewhere There's a big umbrella Casting shade over an empty chair Palm trees are growing, warm breeze is blowing I picture myself right there On some beach, somewhere.  I circled the parking lot Trying to find a spot Just big enough I could park my ol' truck A man with a big cigar Was getting into his car I stopped and I waited for him to back up But from out of nowhere a Mercedez Benz Came cruising up, and whipped right in.  Some beach, somewhere There's nowhere to go When you've got all day to get there There's cold Margaritas And hot senoritas Smiling with long dark hair On somebeach, somewhere.  Well, I sat in that waiting room Seemed like all afternoon The nurse finally said the doc's ready for you You're not gonna feel a thing We'll give you some novacaine That tooth will be fine in a minute or two But he stuck that needle down deep in my gum And he started drilling before I was numb.  Some beach, somewhere There a beautiful sunset burning up the atmosphere There's music and dancing, lovers romancing In the salty evening air On some beach, somewhere.  On somebeach, somewhere...
Do you ever feel like breaking down? Do you ever feel out of place, Like somehow you just don't belong And no one understands you? Do you ever wanna run away?

I watched him take the two strike call He hadn't tried to swing at all I guess he had all he could take He walked away for goodness sake His father's voice was loud and mean "You won't amount to anything".  That little boy quit trying He just walked away There were tear drops on his face Tell me how would you feel You'd probably give up too If nobody believed in you.  That old man said, "One more try I know I'm not too old to drive I promise son, I'll do my best This time I'm gonna pass the test" "Give me the keys dad and get in" His father never drove again.  That old man quit trying He just turned away There were tear drops on his face Tell me how would you feel You'd probably give up too If nobody believed in you.  We take his name out of schools The lawyers say it breaks the rules Pledge of allegiance can not be read And under God should not be said I wonder how much he will take I just pray it's not too late.  What if God quit trying He just turned away There were tear drops on his face Tell me how would you feel You'd probably give up too If nobody believed in you.  Tell me how would you feel You'd probably give up too If nobody believed in you...

She put him out, like the burning end of a midnight cigarette She broke his heart He spend his whole life trying to forget We watch him drink his pain away Little at a time But he never could get drunk enough To get her of his mind until the night He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger And finally drank away her memory Life is short but this time it was bigger And the strength he had to get up off his knees We found him with his face down in the pillow With a note that said I'll love her till I die And when we buried him beneath the willow The Angels sang a whiskey lullaby la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la The rumors flew But nobody knew how much she blamed herself For years and years She tried to hide the whiskey on her breathe She finally drank her pain away little at a time But she never could get drunk enough to get him of her mind Until the night She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger And finally drank away his memory Life is short but this time it was bigger Than the strength she had to get up off her knees We found her with her face down in the pillow Clinging to his picture for dear life We laid her next to him beneath the willow While the Angels sang a whiskey lullaby la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la

He can't remember The times that he thought Does my daddy love me? Probably not That didn't stop him From wishing that he did Didn't keep him from wanting Or worshiping him He guesses he saw him About once a year He could still feel the way he felt Standing in tears Stretching his arms out As far as they'd go Whispering daddy  I want you to know I love you this much And I'm waiting on you To make up your mind Do you love me too? How ever long it takes I'm never giving up no matter what I love you this much He grew to hate him for what he had done  'Cause what kind of father Could do that to his son? He said 'damn you daddy' The day that he died The man didn't blink But the little boy cried  I love you this much  And I'm waiting on you  To make up your mind Do you love me too? How ever long it takes I'm never giving up no matter what I love you this much Half way through the service While the choir sang a hymn He looked up above the preacher And he sat and stared at him He said  'Forgive me father' When he realized That he hadn't been unloved  Or alone all his life His arms were stretched out As far as they'd go Nailed to the cross For the whole world to know I love you this much And I'm waiting on you To make up your mind Do you love me too? How ever long it takes I'm never giving up no matter what I love you this much (end)

He works way too much for way too little He drinks way too early till way too late He hasn't had a raise since New Year's Day in '88 Gets trampled on by everyone Except when he comes in here  And he's the product of the Haggard generation He's got a redneck side when you get him agitated He got the gold toothed look from a stiff right hook He's proud he took for his right wing stand on Vietnam Says he lost his brother there  He yells out Johnny Cash And the band starts to play A ring of fire as he walks up And stands there by the stage  And he says Hell yeah! Turn it up! Right on! Hell yeah! Sounds good! Sing that song! Guitar man, play it all night long Take me back to where the music hit me When life was good and love was easy She's got an MBA and a plush corner office She's got a "don't mess with me" attitude She'll close a deal she don't reveal that she can feel The loneliness the emptiness Except when she comes in here  She's the product of the Me generation She's got a rock and roll side when you get her agitated She got the tattoo there on her derriere From a spring break dare in Panama Where love was all she thought she'd ever need  She yells out to the band "Know any Bruce Springsteen?" Then she jumps up on the bar And she, and she starts to scream  She says Hell yeah! Turn it up! Right on! Hell yeah! Sounds good! Sing that song!

Heaven bend to take my hand And lead me through the fire Be the long awaited answer To a long and painful fight  Truth be told I've tried my best But somewhere along the way I got caught up in all there was to offer And the cost was so much more than I could bear  Though I've tried, I've fallen... I have sunk so low I messed up Better I should know So don't come round here And tell me I told you so...  We all begin with good intent Love was raw and young We believed that we could change ourselves THe past could be undone But we carry on our backs the burden Time always reveals In the lonely light of morning In the wound that would not heal It's the bitter taste of losing everything That I've held so dear.  I've fallen... I have sunk so low I messed up Better I should know So don't come round here And tell me I told you so...  Heaven bend to take my hand Nowhere left to turn I'm lost to those I thought were friends To everyone I know Oh they turn their heads embarassed Pretend that they don't see But it's one missed step One slip before you know it And there doesn't seem a way to be redeemed  Though I've tried, I've fallen... I have sunk so low I messed up Better I should know So don't come round here And tell me I told you so...  Though I've tried, I've fallen... I have sunk so low I messed up Better I should know So don't come round here And tell me I told you so...

All the days you spent with me Now seem so far away And it feels like you don't care anymore  And now I try hard to make it I just want to make you proud I'm never gonna be good enough for you I can't stand another fight And nothing's alright  'Cause we lost it all And nothing lasts forever I'm sorry, I can't be perfect Now it's just too late And we can't go back I'm sorry, I can't be perfect  Nothing's gonna change the things that you said And nothing's gonna make this right again Please don't turn your back I can't believe it's hard just to talk to you But you don't understand (you don't understand...)

Tilling my own grave to keep me level Jam another dragon down the hole Digging to the rhythm and the echo of a solitary siren One that pushes me along and leaves me so  Desperate and ravenous So weak and powerless Over you  Someone feed the monkey while I dig in search of China White as Dracula as I approach the bottom  Desperate and ravenous So weak and powerless Over you  Little angel go away Come again some other day The devil has my ear today I'll never hear a word you say He promised I would find a little solace And some piece of mind Whatever just as long as I don't feel so  Desperate and ravenous So weak and powerless Desperate and ravenous So weak and powerless Over you Over you

This is a call to the colorblind This is an IOU Stranded behind a horizon line Try to be something true  Yes, I'm grounded Got my wings clipped I'm surrounded by All this pavement Guess I'll circle While I'm waiting For my fears to dry  Someday I'll fly Someday I'll soar Someday I'll be Something much more Cause I'm bigger than my body Gives me credit for  Why is it not the time? What is there more to learn?

Back when I was a child Before life removed all the innocence My father would lift me high And dance with my mother and me and then Spin me around till I fell asleep Then up the stairs he would carry me And I knew for sure I was loved  If I could get another chance Another walk, another dance with him I'd play a song that would never ever end How I'd love love love, to dance with my father again  When I and my mother would disagree To get my way, I would run from her to him He'd make me laugh just to comfort me (yeah) Then finally make me do just what my mamma said Later that night when I was asleep He left a dollar under my sheet Never dreamed that he would be gone from me  If I could steal one final glance One final step, one final dance with him I'd play a song that would never, ever end Cause I'd love, love, love to dance with my father again  Sometimes I'd listen outside her door And I'd hear how my mother cried for him I'd pray for her even more than me I'd pray for her even more than me  I know I'm praying for much too much But could you send back the only man she loved I know you don't do it usually But dear Lord she' s dying to dance with my father again Every night I fall asleep and this is all I ever dream

Realized I can never win, Sometimes feel like I have failed. Inside where do I begin? My mind is laughing at me. Tell me, why am I to blame? Aren't we supposed to be the same? That's why I will never tame, This thing that's burning in me.  I am the one who chose my path. I am the one who couldn't last. I feel the life pulled from me. I feel the anger changing me.

Betrayed, I feel so enslaved. I really tried, I did my time. I did my time. I did my time! I did my time! I did my time!  I am the one who chose my path. I am the one who couldn't last. I feel the life pulled from me. I feel the anger changing me.  Oh God, the anger's changing me! Oh God, the anger's changing me!

He had plastic bags wrapped 'round his shoes He was covered with the evening news Had a pair of old wool socks on his hands  The bank sign was flashing 5 below It was freezing rain and spittin' snow He was curled up behind some garbage cans I was afraid that he was dead I gave him a gentle shake When he opened up his eyes I said, "Old man are you ok?"  He said,"I just climbed out of a cottonwood tree I was runnin' from some honey bees Drip dryin' in the summer breeze After jumpin' into Calico creek I was walkin' down an old dirt road Past a field of hay that had just been mowed Man I wish you'd just left me alone 'Cause I was almost home"  He said "I was just comin' round the barn 'Bout the time you grabbed my arm When I heard Momma holler, "Son hurry up" I was close enough for my own nose To smell fresh cobbler on the stove And I saw daddy loadin' up the truck Cane poles on the tailgate Bobbers blowin' in the wind Since July of '55 That's as close as I've been"  He said,"I just climbed out of a cottonwood tree I was runnin' from some honey bees Drip dryin' in the summer breeze After jumpin' into Calico creek I was walkin' down an old dirt road Past a field of hay that had just been mowed Man I wish you'd just left me alone 'Cause I was almost home"  I said,"Old man you're gonna freeze to death Let me drive you to the mission" He said,"Boy if you'd left me alone Right now I'd be fishin'"  He said,"I just climbed out of a cottonwood tree I was runnin' from some honey bees Drip dryin' in the summer breeze After jumpin' into Calico creek I was walkin' down an old dirt road Past a field of hay that had just been mowed Man I wish you'd just left me alone 'Cause I was almost home" Man I wish you'd just left me alone Cause I was almost home (almost home) Man I wish you'd just left me alone I was almost home
Days swiftly come and go I'm dreaming of her She's seeing other guys Emotions astir The sun is gone the nights are long And I am left while the tears fall  Did you think that I would cry, on the phone? Do you know what it feels like, being alone? I'll find someone new  Swing, swing, swing from the tangles of my heart Is crushed by a former love Can you help me find a way to carry on again?  Wish cast into the sky I'm moving on Sweet beginnings do arise She knows I was wrong The notes are old They bend, they fold And so do I to a new love  Did you think that I would cry, on the phone? Do you know what it feels like, being alone? I'll find someone new  Swing, swing, swing from the tangles of my heart Is crushed by a former love Can you help me find a way to carry on again?  Bury me You thought your problems were gone  Carry me away, away, away Swing, swing, swing from the tangles of my heart Is crushed by a former love Can you help me find a way to carry on again? Swing, swing, swing, from the tangles of my heart Is crushed by a former love Can you help me find a way to carry on again? Swing, swing, swing from the tangles of my heart Is crushed by a former love Can you help me find a way to carry on again?

A farmer and a teacher, a hooker and a preacher Ridin' on a midnight bus bound for Mexico. One was headed for vacation, one for higher education And two of them were searchin' for lost souls. That driver never ever saw the stop sign. An' eighteen wheelers can't stop on a dime.  There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway Why there's not four of them, Heaven only knows. I guess it's not what you take when you leave this world behind you It's what you leave behind you when you go.  That farmer left a harvest, a home and eighty acres The faith an' love for growin' things in his young son's heart. And that teacher left her wisdom in the minds of lots of children: Did her best to give 'em all a better start. An' that preacher whispered: "Can't you see the Promised Land?" As he laid his blood-stained bible in that hooker's hand.  There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway Why there's not four of them, Heaven only knows. I guess it's not what you take when you leave this world behind you It's what you leave behind you when you go.  That's the story that our preacher told last Sunday. As he held that blood-stained bible up For all of us to see. He said: "Bless the farmer, and the teacher, an' that preacher "Who gave this Bible to my mamma "Who read it to me."  There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway Why there's not four of them, now I guess we know. It's not what you take when you leave this world behind you It's what you leave behind you when you go.  There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway.
Boys and girls, wanna hear a true story? Saturday night was at this real wild party There was liquor overflowin' the cup, About 5 or 6 strippers trying to work for a buck. So I took one girl outside with me, Her name was Londy, she went to Junior High with me, I said, "Why you up in there dancing for cash? I guess a whole lot's changed since I seen you last." She said...  What would you do if your son was at home Crying all alone On the bedroom floor, Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him is to Sleep with a man for a little bit of money? And his daddy's gone in and out of lock down, I ain't got a job now, He's just smokin' rock now, So for you this is just a good time But for me this is what I call life  Girl, you ain't the only one to have a baby, That's no excuse to be living all crazy So she stared me right square in the eye And said, "Everyday I wake up, hoping to die" She said, "They're gonna know about pain 'Cause me and my sister ran away, So our daddy couldn't rape us, Before I was a teenager I done been through more shit You can't even relate to"  What would you do if your son was at home Crying all alone On the bedroom floor, Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him is to Sleep with a man for a little bit of money? And his daddy's gone in and out of lock down, I ain't got a job now, He's just smokin' rock now, So for you this is just a good time But for me this is what I call life  What would you do? Get up off my feet and stop making tired excuses What would you do? Get up off my feet and stop making tired excuses What would you do? Get up off my feet and stop making tired excuses What would you do? Get up off my feet!  What would you do if your son was at home Crying all alone On the bedroom floor, Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him is to Sleep with a man for a little bit of money?

An' that's the truth about men. You know it, son. (Tell 'em how it is Tracy!)
I hear people saying, we don't need this war. But I say, there's some things worth fighting for.  What about our freedom? And this piece of ground? We didn't get to keep 'em by backin' down. They say we don't realize the mess we're getting in. Before you start to preachin' let me ask you this, my friend. Have you forgotten how it felt that day?  To see our home land under fire, and her people blown away. Have you forgotten when those towers fell? We had neighbors still inside, goin' through a livin' hell. And you say we shouldn't worry 'bout Bin Laden... have you forgotten? They took all the footage off my T.V. Said it's too disturbing, for you and me. It'll just breed anger, that's what the experts say.  If it was up to me, I'd show it every day. Some say this country's just out, lookin' for a fight. Well, after 9u002F11, man, I'd have to say that's right. Have you forgotten how it felt that day? To see our home land under fire, and her people blown away. Have you forgotten when those towers fell?  We had neighbors still inside, goin' through a livin' hell. And we vowed to get the ones behind Bin Laden. Have you forgotten?  I've been there with the soldiers who've gone away to war, and you can bet that they remember just what they're fighting for. Have you forgotten all the people killed? Yeah, some went down like heroes in that Pennsylvania field. Have you forgotten about our pentagon? All the loved ones that we lost, and those left to carry on. Don't you tell me not to worry about Bin Laden. Have you forgotten? Have you forgotten? Have you forgotten?

Of all the things I've believed in I just want to get it over with Tears from behind my eyes but I do not cry Counting the days pass me by  I've been searchin' deep down in my soul Words that I'm hearin' are starting to get old It feels like I'm startin' all over again The last three years were just pretend And I said  Goodbye to you Goodbye to everything that I knew You were the one I loved The one thing that I tried to hold onto  I still get lost in your eyes And it seems that I can't live a day without you Closin' my eyes and you chase my thoughts away To a place where I am blinded by the light But it's not right, ahh  Goodbye to you Goodbye to everything that I knew You were the one I loved The one thing that I tried to hold on to  And it hurts to want everything And nothin' at the same time I want what's yours and I want what's mine I want you but I'm not givin' in this time  Goodbye to you Goodbye to everything that I knew You were the one I loved The one thing that I tried to hold onto  Goodbye to you Goodbye to everything I thought I knew You were the one I loved The one thing that I tried to hold onto The one thing that I tried to hold onto  One thing that I tried to hold onto And when the stars fall I will lie awake You're my shooting star
Last time I talked to you You were lonely and out of place You were looking down on me Lost out in space We laid underneath the stars Strung out and feeling brave I watched the red orange glow I watched you float away  Down here in the atmosphere Garbage and city lights You've gone to save your tired soul You've gone to save our lives I turned on the radio To find you on satellite I'm waiting for this sky to fall I'm waiting for a sign And all we are Is all so far  You're falling back to me The star that I can see, yeah I know you're out there Somewhere out there You're falling out of reach Defying gravity, yeah I know you're out there Somewhere out there  ... Hope you remember me when you're home sick and need a change I miss your purple hair I miss the way you taste I know you'll come back someday On a bed of nails I'll wait I'm praying that you don't burn out Or fade away And all we are  Is all so far  You're falling back to me The star that I can see, yeah I know you're out there Somewhere out there You're falling out of reach Defying gravity, yeah  I know you're out there Somewhere out there  You're falling back to me The star that I can see I know you're out there Oh You're falling out of reach  Defying gravity I know you're out there Somewhere out there  You're falling back to me The star that I can see, yeah I know you're out there Somewhere out there  You're falling out of reach Defying gravity, yeah I know you're out there Somewhere out there You're falling back to me I know, I know You're falling out of reach I know

Just a day, just an ordinary day Just trying to get by Just a boy, just an ordinary boy, but He was looking to the sky and As he asked, if I would come along I started to realize That everyday he finds, just what he's lookin' for Like a shooting star, he shines And he said  Take my hand Live while you can Don't you see your dreams lie right In the palm of your hand  And as he spoke, he spoke ordinary words Although they did not feel, no For I felt what I had not felt before And you'd swear those words could heal, and As I looked up into those eyes His vision borrows mine And I know he's no stranger For I feel I've held him for all of time, and he said  Take my hand Live while you can, Don't you see your dreams lie right In the palm of your hand Right in the palm of your hand  Please come with me Please come with me Take my hands So time will not flee Time will not flee Can't you see  Just a dream, just an ordinary dream As I wake in bed And the boy, that ordinary boy Was it all in my head Did he asked, if I would come along It all seemed so real But as I looked to the door I saw that boy, standing there with a deal, and he said  Take my hand Live while you can Don't you see your dreams lie right In the palm of your hand Right in the palm of your hand Right in the palm of your hand  Just a day, just an ordinary day Just tryin' to get by Just a boy, just an ordinary boy, but He was lookin' to the sky

I was ten, I was thin, I was playing first base with a secondhand glove and dirt on my face In nowhere, Virginia Who'd ever figure that kid in the yard would go very far Cause 419 Lakewood had no silver spoons Just an old beat up upright that played out of tune Now I'm singin' and living the life that I love And when I count my blessings I thank God I was An American child  An American child 'Cause dreams can grow wild Born inside an American child  Seven pounds, three ounces, she's got my nose And she's into my heart as deep as it goes With a promise that's more than just someone's last name Anyone's equal, in late August came An American child  An American child 'Cause dreams can grow wild Born inside an American child  My grandfather would have been eighty today But in '45 he fell down beside an American child  An American child Oh, an American child 'Cause dreams can grow wild born inside an American child An American child
The selfish, they're all standing in line Faithing and hoping to buy themselves time Me, I figure as each breath goes by I only own my mind  The north is to south what the clock is to time There's east and there's west and there's everywhere life I know I was born and I know that I'll die The in-between is mine I am mine  And the feeling, it gets left behind All the innocence lost at one time Significant behind the eyes There's no need to hide We're safe tonight  The ocean is full 'cause everyone's crying The full moon is looking for friends at high tide The sorrow grows bigger when the sorrow's denied I only know my mind I am mine  And the meaning, it gets left behind All the innocence lost at one time Significant behind the eyes There's no need to hide We're safe tonight, whoa  And the feelings that get left behind All the innocence broken with lies Significance between the lines We may need to hide  And the meanings that get left behind All the innocence lost at one time We're all different behind the eyes There's no need to hide

When I walked in, the band just started, The singer couldn't carry a tune in a bucket. Was on a mission to drown her memory but I thought no way with all this ruckus.  But after One round with Jose Cuervo, I caught my boots tappin' 'long with the beat. And after Two rounds with Jose Cuervo, That band was soundin' pretty darn good to me.  Then some stranger asked me dance And I revealed to her my two left feet. Said, "Don't get me wrong I'm glad you asked, But tonight's about me and an old memory."  Then after Three rounds with Jose Cuervo, I let her lead me out on the floor, And after Four rounds with Jose Cuervo, I was showin' off moves never seen before.  Well at round five or round six, I forgot what I came to forget. After round seven -or was it eight?- I bought a round for the whole dang place!  And after Nine rounds with Jose Cuervo, They were countin' me out and I was about to give in, Then after, Ten rounds with Jose Cuervo, I lost count and started countin' again!  One round with Jose Cuervo... I went Two rounds with Jose Cuervo... Three rounds with Jose Cuervo... Five (Four)- or was it four? Hahahahahaha... Six rounds with Jose Cuervo... Eight rounds with Jose Cuervo... Ten rounds with Jose Cuervo...
Welcome to the real world She said to me condescendingly Take a seat, take your life Plot it out in black and white  Well, I never lived the dream of the prom kings And the drama queens I'd like to think the best of me Is still hiding up my sleeve  They love to tell you Stay inside the lines But something's better On the other side  I wanna run through the halls of my high school I wanna scream at the top of my lungs I just found out there's no such thing as the real world Just a lie you've got to rise above  So the good boys and girls Take the so called right track Faded white hats Grabbing credits and maybe transfers  They read all the books but they can't find the answers And all of our parents, they're getting older I wonder if they've wished for anything better While in their memories tiny tragedies  They love to tell you Stay inside the lines But something's better On the other side  I wanna run through the halls of my high school I wanna scream at the top of my lungs I just found out there's no such thing as the real world Just a lie you got to rise above  I am invincible I am invincible I am invincible As long as I'm alive  I wanna run through the halls of my high school I wanna scream at the top of my lungs I just found out there's no such thing as the real world Just a lie you've got to rise above  I just can't wait 'til my ten year reunion I'm gonna bust down the double doors And when I stand on these tables before you You will know what all this time was for

My dad chased monsters from the dark He checked underneath my bed. He could lift me with one arm Way up over top his head. He could loosen rusty bolts With a quick turn of his wrench He pulled splinters from his hand And never even flinched. In thirteen years I'd never seen him cry But the day that grandpa died, I realized: Unsinkable ships sink.  Unbreakable walls break. Sometimes the things you think could never happen Happen just like that. Unbendable steel bends. If the fury of the wind is unstoppable I've learned to never underestimate The impossible. Then there was my junior year Billy had a brand new car.  It was late, the road was wet I guess the curve was just too sharp. I walked away without a scratch. They brought the helicopter in. Billy couldn't feel his legs. Said he'd never walk again. But Billy said he would and his Mom and Daddy prayed And the day we graduated, he stood up to say: "Unsinkable ships sink. "Unbreakable walls break. "Sometimes the things you think could never happen  "Happen just like that. "Unbendable steel bends. "If the fury of the wind is unstoppable "I've learned to never underestimate "The impossible." So don't tell me that it's over. Don't give up on you and me. 'Cause there's no such thing as hopeless If you believe: Unsinkable ships sink.  Unbreakable walls break. Sometimes the things you think could never happen Happen just like that. Unbendable steel bends. If the fury of the wind is unstoppable I've learned to never underestimate The impossible.

I've dealt with my ghosts and I've faced all my demons Finally content with a past I regret I've found you find strength in your moments of weakness For once I'm at peace with myself  I've been burdened with blame, trapped in the past for too long I'm movin' on  I've lived in this place and I know all the faces Each one is different but they're always the same They mean me no harm but it's time that I face it They'll never allow me to change But I never dreamed home would end up where I don't belong I'm movin' on  I'm movin' on At last I can see life has been patiently waiting for me And I know there's no guarantees, but I'm not alone There comes a time in everyone's life When all you can see are the years passing by And I have made up my mind that those days are gone...  I sold what I could and packed what I couldn't Stopped to fill up on my way out of town I've loved like I should but lived like I shouldn't I had to lose everything to find out Maybe forgiveness will find me somewhere down this road I'm movin' on I'm movin' on I'm movin' on

Just Let Me Be In Love (Tom Shapiro, Mark Nessler, Tony Martin)  English Version  My breath is short, my heart is beating fast Every time I smile at her she's smiling back If I'm dreaming, please just let me sleep Anyone can see that she's too good for me Oh, give her time, she'll find out soon enough Just let me have and hold her 'til she does  What we've got going on is so incredible This chemistry between us feels so wonderful But knowing me, I'll probably Find a way to mess it up Who knows, who cares, right now Just let me be in love  Don't concern me with reality Don't convince me she's too heavenly Forget the future, disregard the past Those are questions I don't want to ask To my heart, all that matters is tonight Just let me live this moment in her eyes  What we've got going on is so incredible This chemistry between us feels so wonderful But knowing me, I'll probably Find a way to mess it up Who knows, who cares, right now Just let me be in love  What we've got going on is so incredible This chemistry between us feels so wonderful But knowing me, I'll probably Find a way to mess it up Who knows, who cares, right now Just let me be in love  Who knows, who cares, right now Just let me be in love Let me be in love I just want to be in love
Well if you ask me where I come from Here's what I tell everyone: I was born by God's dear grace In an extraordinary place Where the stars and stripes and the eagle fly  It's a big ol' land with countless dreams Happiness ain't out of reach Hard work pays off the way it should Yeah, I've seen enough to know that we've got it good Where the stars and stripes and the eagle fly  There's a lady that stands in a harbor For what we believe And there's a bell that still echoes The price that it cost to be free  I pledge allegiance to this flag And if that bothers you, well that's too bad But if you got pride and you're proud you do Hey, we could use some more like me and you Where the stars and stripes and the eagle fly  Yes, there's a lady that stands in a harbor For what we believe And there's a bell that still echoes The price that it cost to be free  No, it ain't the only place on earth But it's the only place that I prefer To love my wife and raise my kids Hey, the same way that my daddy did Where the stars and stripes and the eagle fly Where the stars and stripes and the eagle fly Where the stars and stripes and the eagle fly

I'm not afraid Of anything in this world There's nothing you can throw at me That I haven't already heard I'm just trying to find A decent melody A song that I can sing In my own company  I never thought you were a fool But darling, look at you. Ooh. You gotta stand up straight, carry your own weight 'Cause tears are going nowhere baby  You've got to get yourself together You've got stuck in a moment And now you can't get out of it Don't say that later will be better Now you're stuck in a moment And you can't get out of it  I will not forsake The colors that you bring The nights you filled with fireworks They left you with nothing I am still enchanted By the light you brought to me I listen through your ears Through your eyes I can see  You are such a fool To worry like you do. Oh I know it's tough And you can never get enough Of what you don't really need now My, oh my  You've got to get yourself together You've got stuck in a moment And you can't get out of it Oh love, look at you now You've got yourself stuck in a moment And you can't get out of it Oh lord look at you now You've got yourself stuck in a moment And you cant get out of it  I was unconscious, half asleep The water is warm 'til you discover how deep I wasn't jumping, for me it was a fall It's a long way down to nothing at all  You've got to get yourself together You've got stuck in a moment And you can't get out of it Don't say that later will be better Now you're stuck in a moment And you can't get out of it  And if the night runs over And if the day won't last And if your way should falter Along this stony pass  It's just a moment This time will pass
I try to breathe Memories overtaking me I try to face them but The thought is too much to conceive  I only know that I can change Everything else just stays the same So now I step out of the darkness that my life became 'cause  I just needed someone to talk to You were just too busy with yourself You were never there for me To express how I felt I just stuffed it down Now I'm older and I feel like I could let some of this anger fade But it seems the surface I am scratching Is the bed that I have made  So where were you? When all this I was going through You never took the time To ask me just what you could do  I only know that I can change Everything else just stays the same So now I step out of the darkness that my life became 'cause  I just needed someone to talk to You were just too busy with yourself You were never there for me To express how I felt I just stuffed it down Now I'm older and I feel like I could let some of this anger fade But it seems the surface I am scratching Is the bed that I have made  I never meant to fade... Away  I NEVER MEANT TO FADE  I just needed someone to talk to You were just too busy with yourself You were never there for me To express how I felt I just stuffed it down Now I'm older and I feel like I could let some of this anger fade But it seems the surface I am scratching Is the bed that I have made  I try to breathe...

Sometimes I think what turned her on, Was my old broke down boots. She wanted her a real cowboy, It was a phase she was goin' through. Not one week after she moved in, I caught her paintin' the bedroom blue.  Brought home a bottle of pink chablis, Poured out my best home brew. I was sittin' on the porch in my overalls, As she packed her things to leave.  She changed her mind when she couldn't change me. She changed direction, headed out west. Changed her tune to some hip-hop mess. Her dark brown hair went to blonde, And her pretty blue eyes went to green. She changed everything when she couldn't change me.  She was sittin' beside the ocean, Lookin' out at the waves. Watchin' how they keep on rollin', They always seem the same. She called and said she'd been thinkin' about,  All those quiet country nights. And whatever she thought was so wrong with me, Suddenly seemed all right. I was sittin' on the porch in my overalls, When her truck pulled into view. She said: "I changed my mind when I couldn't change you."  She changed direction, headed back home. She changed her tune, it's all Haggard and Jones. Had her dark brown hair pulled back, And the bluest eyes you ever seen. She changed everything when she couldn't change me.  She said: "I guess when you love someone you just gotta let it be." She changed her mind when she couldn't change me.  She changed direction, she's back in my arms. She thought it through, had a change of heart. She said: "I guess when you love someone you just gotta let it be." She changed her mind when she couldn't change me.  Yeah, yeah... She changed it all when she couldn't change me. She couldn't change me. She couldn't change me.
A baby's born in the middle of the night In a local delivery room They grab his feet, smack him till he cries He goes home the next afternoon Before you know it, he's off to school And then he graduates in May Goes out and gets a Phd and then Cures all sorts of things Wins the Noble prize and saves a million different lives The world's a better place for all he's done It's funny when you think about the reason he's alive  It's all because two people fell in love Right now at a picnic shelter down by Caney Creek You'll find potato salad, hot dogs and baked beans The whole Wilson family's lined up filling their paper plates And they've drove or flown in here from fifteen different states Stanley Wilson says that sixty years ago he knew That Miss Emma Tucker was the one Now five generations get together every June And all because two people fell in love  Yeah, there ain't nothing not affected When two hearts get connected All that is, will be or ever was Every single choice we make Every breath we get to take Is all because two people fell in love  While I recall a young man Who was drifting aimlessly And a young waitress who seemed lonesome as could be But in a little cafe right off of 14th Avenue With a whole lot of help from up above We met and things sure turned around for me and you And all because two people fell in love  And baby, there ain't nothing not affected When two hearts get connected All that is, will be or ever was I'm glad your dad could not resist Your momma's charms and you exist All because two people fell in love  You know to me it's all so clear Everyone of us is here All because two people fell in love A baby's born in the middle of the night In the local delivery room They grab his feet smack him until he cries He goes home the next afternoon

Can you feel a little love? As your bony fingers close around me Long and spindly Death becomes me Heaven can you see what I see? Hey you pale and sickly child You're death and living reconciled Been walking home a crooked mile Paying debt to karma You party for a living What you take won't kill you But careful what you're given Mmmh There's no time for hesitating Pain is ready, pain is waiting Primed to do it's educating Unwanted, uninvited kin It creeps beneath your crawling skin It lives without it lives within you Feel the fever coming You're shaking and twitching You can scratch all over But that won't stop you itching Can you feel a little love? Can you feel a little love? Dream on, dream on Blame it on your karmic curse Or shame upon the universe It knows its lines It's well rehearsed It sucked you in, it dragged you down  To where there is no hallowed ground  Where holiness is never found  Paying debt to karma  You party for a living What you take won't kill you But careful what you're given Can you feel a little love? Can you feel a little love? Dream on, dream on Can you feel a little love? Can you feel a little love? Dream on, dream on Dream on, dream on Dream on, dream on
I got rice cooking in the microwave Got a three day beard I don't plan to shave And it's a goofy thing but I just gotta say Hey I'm doing alright  Yeah I think I'll make me some homemade soup Feelin' pretty good and that's the truth It's neither drink nor drug induced No I'm just doin' alright  And it's a great day to be alive I know the sun's still shinin' when I close my eyes There's some hard times in the neighborhood But why can't every day be just this good?  Oh, yeah  It's been fifteen years since I left home Said good luck to every seed I'd sown Give it my best and then I left it alone Oh, I hope they're doin' alright  Now I look in the mirror and what do I see? A lone wolf there starin' back at me Long in the tooth but harmless as can be Lord I guess he's doin' alright  And it's a great day to be alive I know the sun's still shinin' when I close my eyes There's some hard times in the neighborhood But why can't every day be just this good?  Sometimes it's lonely Sometimes it's only me And the shadows that fill this room  Sometimes I'm fallin' Desperately callin' Howlin' at the moon  Well I might go get me a new tattoo Or take my old Harley for a three day cruise Might even grow me a fu man chu And it's a great day to be alive I know the sun's still shinin' when I close my eyes There's some hard times in the neighborhood But why can't every day be just this good? It's a great day to be alive I know the sun's still shinin' when I close my eyes There's some hard times in the neighborhood But why can't every day be just this good? Oh, yeah-e-yeah
Girls can wear jeans And cut their hair short Wear shirts and boots 'Cause it's OK to be a boy But for a boy to look like a girl is degrading 'Cause you think that being a girl is degrading But secretly you'd love to know what it's like Wouldn't you What it feels like for a girl  Silky smooth Lips as sweet as candy, baby Tight blue jeans Skin that shows in patches  Strong inside but you don't know it Good little girls they never show it When you open up your mouth to speak Could you be a little weak  Do you know what it feels like for a girl Do you know what it feels like in this world For a girl  Hair that twirls on finger tips so gently, baby Hands that rest on jutting hips repenting  Hurt that's not supposed to show And tears that fall when no one knows When you're trying hard to be your best Could you be a little less  Do you know what it feels like for a girl, do you know what it feels like in this world Do you know what it feels like for a girl, do you know what it feels like in this world What it feels like for a girl  Strong inside but you don't know it Good little girls they never show it When you open up your mouth to speak Could you be a little weak  Do you know what it feels like for a girl Do you know what it feels like in this world For a girl  Do you know what it feels like like for a girl Do you know What it feels like in this world
I've been searching for you I heard a cry within my soul I've never had a yearning quite like this before Now that you are walking right through my door  All of my life Where have you been I wonder if I'll ever see you again And if that day comes I know we could win I wonder if I'll ever see you again  A sacred gift of heaven For better worse wherever And I would never let somebody break you down. Until you cried... never  All of my life Where have you been I wonder if I'll ever see you again And if that day comes I know we could win I wonder if I'll ever see you again  At every time, I've always known That you where there, upon your throne A lonely queen, without her king I longed for you, my love forever (...) All of my life Where have you been I wonder if I'll ever see you again And if that day comes I know we could win I wonder if I'll ever see you again  All of my life Where have you been I wonder if I'll ever see you again And if that day comes I know we could win I wonder if I'll ever see you again  All of my life Where have you been I wonder if I'll ever see you again And if that day comes I know we could win I wonder if I'll ever see you again I wonder if I'll ever see you again I wonder if I'll ever see you again I wonder if I'll ever see you again I wonder if I'll ever see you again I wonder if I'll ever see you again I wonder if I'll ever see you again I wonder if I'll ever see you again

Last night I had a crazy dream A wish was granted just for me It could be for anything I didn't ask for money Or a mansion in Malibu I simply wished, for one more day with you.  One more day One more time One more sunset, maybe I'd be satisfied But then again I know what it would do Leave me wishin' still, for one more day with you. One more day.  First thing I'd do, is pray for time to crawl I'd unplug the telephone  And keep the tv off I'd hold you every second Say a million I love you's That's what I'd do, with one more day with you. One more day One more time  One more sunset, maybe I'd be satisfied But then again I know what it would do Leave me wishin' still, for one more day with you. One more day One more time One more sunset, maybe I'd be satisfied  But then again I know what it would do Leave me wishin' still, for one more day Leave me wishin' still for one more day Leave me wishin' still for one more day With you. One more day...

Good, and I would  If I knew I was understood  And it'll be great, just wait  Or is it too little too late?

When we met, light was shed Thoughts free flow You said you've got something Deep inside of you A wind chime voice sounds Sway of your hips 'round rings true It goes deep inside of you These secret garden beams Change my life so it seems A fall breeze blows outside  I don't break stride Thoughts are warm And they go  deep inside of you  Oh yeah Well I never felt alone Alright Oh oh uh, oh oh uh Till I met you  Friends say I've changed I don't listen  'Cause I live to be Deep inside of you  Slide up her dress Shouts in darkness I'm so alive  I'm deep inside of you You said boy made girl feel good But still,  deep inside Still I never felt alone, till I met you  I'm alright on my own  And then I met you And I'd know what to do If I just knew, what's comin'  I would change myself if I could I walk with my people  if I could find them And I'd say that I'm sorry to you I'm sorry to you And I don't wanna call you But then I wanna call you 'Cause I don't wanna crush you But I feel like crushing you And it's true, I took for granted You were with me I breathe by your looks And you look right through me (We were broken) (Didn't know it) (We were broken) (Didn't know it) (We were broken) (Didn't know it) (We were broken) (Didn't know it) (Lies, all lies) (That's right) (All) Somethings gone You withdraw I'm not strong, like before I was deep inside of you I can go nowhere I burn candles and stare At a ghost Deep inside of you And some great need in me Starts to bleed, I've lost myself There's nothin' left, it's all gone Deep inside of you Deep inside of you Mmmm Deep inside of you
Downtown, stoplight, red car rolls by, what else can I do But wonder if it's you Scanning the stations, every song they're playin' is like a soundtrack To the love we had  I should be over you by now But every time I turn around  It's always somethin', every day remindin' me Everywhere I go, there's a memory Ready and awaitin' to catch me off guard There's no way to prepare my heart  What I wouldn't give, what I wouldn't do If only I could just stop missin' you I'd let go of our love, like it was never nothing But it's always something  Lunch time, a new place, waitress says her name Why does it have to be, Emily? Corner store, stop in, someone ask, "How you been?" I say,? I wouldn't know, I really gotta go?  Wish I could forget you, but I don't know how 'Cause every time I turn around  It's always somethin' every day remindin' me Everywhere I go, there's a memory Ready and awaitin' to catch me off guard There's no way to prepare my heart  What I wouldn't give, what I wouldn't do If only I could just stop missin' you I'd let go of our love, like it was never nothing But it's always  Somethin' every day remindin' me Everywhere I go, there's a memory Ready and awaitin' to catch me off guard There's no way to prepare my heart  What I wouldn't give, what I wouldn't do If only I could just stop missin' you I'd let go of our love, like it was never nothing But it's always something  It's always something Oh, it's always something It's always something
I don't need a lot of things  I can get by with nothing Of all the blessings life can bring I've always needed something But I've got all I want When it comes to loving you You're my only reason  You're my only truth I need you like water Like breath, like rain I need you like mercy From heaven's gate There's a freedom in your arms That carries me through  I need you You're the hope that moves me To courage again You're the love that rescues me When the cold winds, rage And it's so amazing 'Cause that's just how you are And I can't turn back now  'Cause you've brought me too far I need you like water Like breath, like rain I need you like mercy From heaven's gate There's a freedom in your arms That carries me through I need you  Oh yes I do I need you like water Like breath, like rain I need you like mercy From heaven's gate There's a freedom in your arms And it carries me through I need you Oh yes I do I need you
Faith: Baby, I've been drifting away Dreaming all day Of holding you Touching you  The only thing I want to do Is be with you As close to you As I can be  Let's make love, all night long Until all our strength is gone Hold on tight, just let go I want to feel you in my soul Until the sun comes up Let's make love  Oh, baby  Tim: Do you know what you do to me Everything inside of me Is wanting you And needing you  I'm so in love with you Look in my eyes Let's get lost tonight In each other  Let's make love, all night long Until all our strength is gone Hold on tight, just let go I want to feel you in my soul Until the sun comes up Let's make love  Let's make love, all night long Until all our strength is gone Hold on tight, just let go I want to feel you in my soul Until the sun comes up Oh, until the sun comes up Let's make love Oh baby, let's make love All night long, all night long Let's make love
This is the story of a girl Who cried a river and drowned the whole world! And while she looked so sad in photographs I absolutely love her When she smiles...  How many days in a year? She woke up with hope but she only found tears. And i can be so insincere Making her promises never for real! As long as she stands there waiting Wearing the holes in the soles of her shoes! How many days disappear? When you look in the mirror so how do you choose? Your clothes never wear as well the next day And your hair never falls in quite the same way But you never seem to run out of things to say  This is the story of a girl Who cried a river and drowned the whole world! And while she looked so sad in photographs I absolutely love her When she smiles...  How many lovers would stay? Just to put of with this shit day after day! How did we wind up this way? Watching our mouths for the words that we say. As long as we stand here waiting Wearing the clothes of the souls that we choose! How do we get there today? When we're walking to far for the price of our shoes!  Your clothes never wear as well the next day And your hair never falls in quite the same way But you never seem to run out of things to say!  This is the story of a girl Who cried a river and drowned the whole world! And while she looked so sad in photographs I absolutely love her When she smiles...  Your clothes never wear as well the next day And your hair never falls in quite the same way But you never seem to run out of things to say! This is the story of a girl Who cried a river and drowned the whole world! And while she looks so sad in photographs I absolutely love her-  This is the story of a girl Her pretty face she hid from the world! And while she looks so sad and lonely there I absolutely love her This is the story of a - girl! Who cried a river and drowned the whole world! And while she looks so sad in photographs I absolutely love her When she smiles... When she smiles.
I can feel the magic floating in the air Being with you gets me that way I watch the sunlight dance across your face And I've never been this swept away All my thoughts just seem to settle on the breeze When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms The whole world just fades away The only thing I hear is the beating of your heart  Cause I can feel you breathe It's washing over me And suddenly I'm melting into you There's nothing left to prove Baby all we need is just to be Caught up in the touch Slow and steady rush Baby isn't that the way that love's supposed to be? I can feel you breathe Just breathe  In a way I know my heart is waking up As all the walls come tumbling down Closer than I've ever felt before And I know, and you know There's no need for words right now  Cause I can feel you breathe It's washing over me And suddenly I'm melting into you There's nothing left to prove Baby all we need is just to be Caught up in the touch Slow and steady rush Baby isn't that the way that love's supposed to be? I can feel you breathe Just breathe  Caught up in the touch Slow and steady rush Baby isn't that the way that love's supposed to be? I can feel you breathe, just breathe I can feel the magic floating in the air Being with you gets me that way

Somewhere there's speaking It's already coming in Oh and it's rising at the back of your mind You never could get it Unless you were fed it Now you're here and you don't know why  But under skinned knees and the skid marks Past the places where you used to learn You howl and listen Listen and wait for the  Echoes of angels who won't return  He's everything you want He's everything you need He's everything inside of you That you wish you could be He says all the right things At exactly the right time  But he means nothing to you And you don't know why  You're waiting for someone To put you together  You're waiting for someone to push you away There's always another wound to discover There's always something more you wish he'd say  He's everything you want He's everything you need  He's everything inside of you That you wish you could be He says all the right things At exactly the right time  But he means nothing to you  And you don't know why But you'll just sit tight And watch it unwind It's only what you're asking for And you'll be just fine  With all of your time It's only what you're waiting for Out of the island Into the highway Past the places where you might have turned You never did notice But you still hide away The anger of angels who won't return He's everything you want He's everything you need He's everything inside of you That you wish you could be He says all the right things At exactly the right time But he means nothing to you And you don't know why I am everything you want I am everything you need I am everything inside of you That you wish you could be I say all the right things At exactly the right time But I mean nothing to you and I don't know why And I don't know why Why I don't know

For a long time I was in love Not only in love, I was obsessed With a friendship that no one else could touch It didn't work out, I'm covered in shells  And all I wanted was the simple things A simple kind of life And all I needed was a simple man So I could be the wife  I'm so ashamed, I've been so mean I don't know how it got to this point Oh, I always was the one with all love You came along, I'm hunting you down  Like a sick domestic abuser Looking for a fight And all I wanted was the simple things A simple kind of life  If we met tomorrow for the very first time Would it start all over again?

He was driving home one evening, in his beat up Pontiac. When an old lady flagged him down; Her Mercedes had a flat. He could see that she was frightened, Standing out there in the snow. 'Till he said "I'm here to help you ma'am, By the way, my name's Joe."  She said, "I'm from St. Louis", And I'm only passing through, I must've seen a hundred cars go by, This is awful nice of you."  When he changed the tire, and closed her trunk, And was about to drive away, She said, "How much do I owe you?"  Here's what he had to say:  : Chorus: You don't owe me a thing, I've been there too. And someone once helped me out, Just the way I'm helping you. If you really wanna pay me back, Here's what you do: Don't let the chain of love end with you.  Well a few miles down the road, The lady saw a small cafe. She went in to grab a bite to eat, And then be on her way. But she couldn't help but notice, How the waitress smiled so sweet And how she must've been eight months along, And dead on her feet.  No, she didn't know her story, And she probably never will, When the waitress went to get her change, From a hundred dollar bill, The lady slipped right out the door, And on a napkin left a note. There were tears in the waitress's eyes, When she read what she wrote:  : Chorus: You don't owe me a thing, I've been there too. And someone once helped me out, Just the way I'm helping you. If you really wanna pay me back, Here's what you do: Don't let the chain of love end with you.  That night when she got home from work, The waitress climbed into bed. She was thinking 'bout the money, And what the lady's note had said. As her husband lay there sleeping, She whispered soft and low: "Everything's gonna be alright; I love you, Joe."

I was lousy at math, a failed historian Carlene was the valedictorian I was quarterback in the back of the class She was the whiz kid in the horned-rim glasses It'd been a long time since I'd been around Since I'd set foot on my old stomping ground I ended up by the old school yard And this redhead pulls up in a blue sports car and says "I'll bet you don't remember, I guess it's been forever" It took a second to put it all together, I said  Oh la la la la la lookin' good Carlene Oh my my my my my time's been good to you, if you know what I mean Girl you glitter like Hollywood Good gosh Carlene, you sure are lookin' good  She said "Hop in, let's go for a spin Tell me what you been doing boy and where you've been" I said "I write songs, you probably didn't know and I finally got a couple out on country radio" She said "What a switch, ain't life funny I've got a PhD, now I'm modeling for money Imagine Little Miss 4.0 Just smiling for the camera on the cover of Vogue" I said "You've come a long way since graduation Let me say without reservation You've surpassed everyone's expectations"  Oh la la la la la lookin' good Carlene Oh my my my my my time's been good to you, if you know what I mean Girl you glitter like Hollywood Good gosh Carlene, you sure are lookin' good  I said "I hope to see you again someday" She said "Another ten years is too long to wait Pick me up at my mama's at eight," I said  Oh la la la la la lookin' good Carlene Oh my my my my my time's been good to you, if you know what I mean Oh la la la la la lookin' good Carlene Oh my my my my my time's been good to you, if you know what I mean
I like blue eyes, hers are green Not like the woman of my dreams And her hair's not quite as long as I had planned. Five foot three isn't tall She's not the girl I'd pictured at all. In those paint by number Fantasies I've had.  So it took me by complete suprise When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes. She's not at all what I was lookin for, she's more  No, it wasn't at first sight But the moment I looked twice. I saw the women I was born to love. Her laughter filled my soul When I hold her I don't wanna let go When it comes to her, I can't get enough  So it took me by complete suprise when my heart got lost in those deep green eyes. She's not at all what I was lookin for, she's more!  More than I dreamed of More than any man deserves... and I couldn't ask for a more than a love like hers So it took me by complete suprise When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes. She's not at all what I was lookin for, she's more

I've seen this place a thousand times I've felt this all before And every time you call I've waited there as though you might not call at all  I know this face I'm wearing now I've seen this in my eyes And though it feels so great, I'm still afraid That you'll be leaving anytime  We've done this once and then you closed the door Don't let me fall again for nothing more  Don't say you love me unless forever Don't tell me you need me, if you're not gonna stay Don't give me this feeling, I'll only believe it Make it real or take it all away  I've caught myself smiling alone Just thinking of your voice And dreaming of your touch, is all too much You know I don't have any choice  Don't say you love me unless forever Don't tell me you need me, if you're not gonna stay Don't give me this feeling, I'll only believe it Make it real or take it all away... Yeah, yeah yeah  We've done this once and then you closed the door Don't let me fall again for nothing more  Don't say you love me unless forever Don't tell me you need me, if you're not gonna stay Don't give me this feeling, I'll only believe it Make it real or take it all away  (Say you love me...) Don't tell me you need me, if you're not gonna stay Don't give me this feeling, I'll only believe it Make it real, (make it real,) or take it all away Take it all away, take it all away...
