I like fast cars, and shop grease chased a lot of crazy things left behind my share of broken pieces this morning I turned 36, and you just remember half of it you wonder how you out-lived Hank and Jesus  I put the rage in a river, the roll in a thunder but you kept me from goin' under, when that current got too heavy I always thought I'd be a heap of metal in a cloud of smoke, foot stuck to the pedal Sold for parts like a junkyard rusted-out Chevy Fear, I've had none what the hell made you want to love a man, who was gonna die young  In the mirror, I saw my surprise when those gray hairs like to hide, on my head didn't think he'd live past thirty If I make it thirty more, it's the brown that you'll be looking for as you run your fingers through, say "slow down, honey"  I put the rage in a river, the roll in a thunder but you kept me from goin' under, when that current got too heavy I always thought I'd be a heap of metal in a cloud of smoke, foot stuck to the pedal Sold for parts like a junkyard rusted-out Chevy Fear, I've had none what the hell made you want to love a man, who was gonna die young  Call it intuition, or call it crazy just thought by now I'd be pushing up daisies but I'd gladly stick around if we're together So baby when you bow your head tonight could you tell the Lord I've changed my mind? And with you I'd like to live, well...

Seventeen, the only way I had a car Is after I dropped my mama off where she needed to go  Four bald tires, with the ceiling falling and the window stuck But the only thing I cared about was the radio  We'd turn it on, turn it up to ten and everybody would jump on in Ridin' down the highway Who wants to be the DJ I'll find a spot on the side of the road You find somethin' on the radio  Like a feel real good song We'll know it when it comes on Didn't have no money, no place to go All we needed was a radio  I'd grab my girl, we'd look for somewhere to watch the stars The perfect place to put it in park and take it slow  She'd sing along, to even the ones that she barely knew She sounded good a little outta tune, but we didn't care I'd look at her, she' d look at me, I'll never forget that melody  Ridin' down the highway Who wants to be the DJ I'll find a spot on the side of the road You find somethin' on the radio  Like a feel real good song We'll know it when it comes on Didn't have no money, no place to go All we needed was a radio  Shhh, hey y'all be quit That's my favorite song Hey man turn it up Come on, come on, come on  Ridin' down the highway Who wants to be the DJ I'll find a spot on the side of the road You find somethin' on the radio  Like a feel real good song We'll know it when it comes on Didn't have no money, no place to go All we needed was a radio (radio, ra-radio All we needed, all we needed now Was a, was a, was a radio

The Southern wind sings again an island lullaby  Baby powder beach under my feet has got me rolling And the breeze through crackling leaves like a daytime campfire burning And the ship is off to sea And the wake it is a churning As the Southern wind sings again an island lullaby  You can jump right in Let the music pull you in You can jump right in Oh and lose yourself again As the Southern wind sings again an island lullaby  There's a place the locals go and no one knows where to find it And the river starts to flow inside the clouds of Misty Mountain The water from this stone below becomes a blue-green fountain As the Southern wind sings again an island lullaby  You can jump right in Let the music pull you in You can jump right in Oh and lose yourself again As the Southern wind sings again an island lullaby  La la la la la la, la la la la la La la la la la la la, la la la la La la la la la la la, la la la la la La la la la la la la, la la la  You can find me where the music meets the ocean If you get the notion Stop on by and play a while Simple tune to get your love light glowing Keep your heart wide open Disappear just like the tide Let it roll on by And jump right in Let the music pull you in You can jump right in Oh and lose yourself again As the Southern wind sings again an island lullaby Southern wind sings again an island lullaby Island lullaby

If I live to be a hundred And never see the seven wonders That'll be alright If I don't make it to the big leagues If I never win a Grammy I'm gonna be just fine Cause I know exactly who I am  I am Rosemary's granddaughter The spitting image of my father And when the day is done my momma's still my biggest fan Sometimes I'm clueless and I'm clumsy But I've got friends that love me And they know just where I stand It's all a part of me And that's who I am  So when I make a big mistake And when I fall flat on my face I know I'll be alright Should my tender heart be broken I will cry those teardrops knowing I will be just fine Cause nothing changes who I am  I am Rosemary's granddaughter The spitting image of my father And when the day is done my momma's still my biggest fan Sometimes I'm clueless and I'm clumsy But I've got friends that love me And they know just where I stand It's all a part of me And that's who I am  I'm a saint and I'm a sinner I'm a loser; I'm a winner I am steady and unstable I'm young, but I am able  I am Rosemary's granddaughter The spitting image of my father And when the day is done my momma's still my biggest fan Sometimes I'm clueless and I'm clumsy But I've got friends that love me And they know where I stand It's all a part of me And that's who I am  I am Rosemary's granddaughter The spitting image of my father And when the day is done my momma's still my biggest fan Sometimes I'm clueless and I'm clumsy But I've got friends that love me And they know where I stand It's all a part of me And that's who I am That's who I am!
On a long and lonesome highway, east of Omaha You can listen to the engine moanin' out it's one note song You can think about the woman, or the girl you knew the night before But your thoughts will soon be wandering, the way they always do When you're riding sixteen hours and there's nothing there to do And you don't feel much like riding, you just wish the trip was through  Here I am, on the road again There I am, on the stage Here I go, playing star again There I go, turn the page  Well you walk into a restaurant all strung out from the road And you feel the eyes upon you as you're shaking off the cold You pretend it doesn't bother you, but you just want to explode  Most times you can't hear 'em talk, other times you can All the same old cliche's, is it woman is it man? You always seem outnumbered, so you don't dare make a stand  Here I am, on the road again There I am, on the stage Here I go, playing star again There I go, turn the page  Out there in the spotlight you're a million miles away Every ounce of energy, you try to give away As the sweat pours out your body like the music that you play  Later in the evening as you lie awake in bed With the echoes from the amplifiers ringin' in your head You smoke the days last cigarette, remembering what she said  Here I am, on the road again There I am, up on the stage Here I go, playing star again There I go, turn the page  Here I am, on the road again There I am, on the stage yeah Here I go, playing star again  There I go, there I go
When all our tears have reached the sea Part of you will live in me Way down deep inside my heart The days keep coming without fail A new wind is gonna find your sail That's where your journey starts  You'll find better love Strong as it ever was Deep as the river runs Warm as the morning sun Please remember me  Just like the waves down by the shore We're gonna keep on coming back for more 'Cause we don't ever wanna stop Out in this brave new world you seek Oh the valleys and the peaks And I can see you on the top  You'll find better love Strong as it ever was Deep as the river runs Warm as the morning sun Please remember me  Remember me when you're out walkin' When the snow falls high outside your door Late at night when you're not sleepin' And moonlight falls across your floor When I can't hurt you anymore  You'll find better love Strong as it ever was Deep as the river runs Warm as the morning sun Please remember me Please remember me

Everybody down in Huston calls him "Texas". Everybody way up North calls him "Cornbread". You shoulda heard the way that his momma called him "baby" daddy called him "boy", his friends call him "crazy". Shoulda just called it like I saw it. Shoulda just called for help and ran like hell that day. The burning, the stinging, the high and the heat and the "left-me-wanting-more" feeling when he kissed me. I shoulda just called him "Whiskey". Warm my body to the core just like a blanket. His face was so sweet then he took my breath away. Hit me so hard like a rock through a window. I knew I was in trouble from the moment I met you, boy. Shoulda just called it like I saw it. Shoulda just called for help and ran like hell that day. The burning, the stinging, the high and the heat and the "left-me-wanting-more" feeling when he kissed me. I shoulda just called him "Whiskey" Now the numb has set in. He's gone like the wind. And I can barely feel the pain. Shoulda just called it like I saw it. Shoulda just called for help and ran like hell that day. The burning, the stinging, the high and the heat and the "left-me-wanting-more" feeling when he kissed me. The burning, the stinging, the high and the heat and the "left-me-wanting-more" feeling when he kissed me. I shoulda just called him "Whiskey". Shoulda just called him "Whiskey". I shoulda just called him "Whiskey".

If you ain't got two kids by 21, you're probably gonna die alone. At least that's what tradition told you. And it don't matter if you don't believe, come Sunday morning You best be there in the front row like you're supposed to.  Same hurt in every heart. Same trailer, different park.  Mama's hooked on Mary Kay. Brother's hooked on Mary Jane. Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down. Mary, Mary quite contrary. We get bored, so, we get married. Just like dust, we settle in this town. On this broken merry go 'round and 'round and 'round we go. Where it stops nobody knows. And it ain't slowin' down This merry go 'round.  We think the first time's good enough. So, we hold on to high school love. Sayin' we won't end up like our parents. Tiny little boxes in a row, ain't whatcha want, it's whatcha know. Just happy in the shoes you're wearin'.  Same checks we're always cashin' To buy a little more distraction.  'Cause mama's hooked on Mary Kay. Brother's hooked on Mary Jane. Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down. Mary, Mary, quite contrary. We get bored, so, we get married. Just like dust, we settle in this town. On this broken merry go 'round and 'round and 'round we go Where it stops nobody knows, And it ain't slowin' down. This merry go 'round.  Mary, Mary, quite contrary. We're so bored until we're buried. Just like dust, we settle in this town. On this broken merry go 'round. Merry go 'round.  Jack and Jill went up the hill. Jack burned out on booze and pills. And Mary had a little lamb. Mary just don't give a damn no more.

I remember when my heart caught the fever You were standing all alone in the summer heat I was with my boyfriend, my new boyfriend He was as sweet as he could be  One look at you and I was through My heart switched up on me  Like a postcard from Paris When I've seen the real thing It's like finding out your diamond is From her old promise ring  A call back from your fortune teller She read your cards upside down The meanest thing you ever did is Come around  And now I'm ruined, yeah I'm ruined  In the evening you can catch me daydreaming Did that moment send you reeling just like me I should have gone over, right over I should have never let you leave  But it's the never knowing that keeps This going and drives me crazy  Like a postcard from Paris When I've seen the real thing It's like finding out your diamond is From her old promise ring  A call back from your fortune teller She read your cards upside down The meanest thing you ever did is Come around  Just when I thought things were alright My eyes played tricks on my mind Will I ever be satisfied 'Cause all I ever seem to find, is a  Postcard from Paris When I need the real thing It's like finding out your diamond is From an old promise ring  A call back from your fortune teller She read your cards upside down The meanest thing you ever did The cruelest thing you ever did The meanest thing you ever did Is come around  I am ruined, yeah I'm ruined Now I am ruined, yeah I'm ruined
I kept waiting on a reason In a call that never came No I never saw it coming Somethin' in you must have changed  All the words unspoken Promises broken I cried for so long Wasted too much time Should've seen the signs Now I know just what went wrong  I guess I wanted you more And looking back now I'm sure I wanted you more I guess I wanted you more  All the nights we spent just talking Of the things we wanted out of life (out of life) Making plans and dreams together I wish I'd seen I was just too blind  My heart was open Exposed and hoping for you To lay it on the line But in the end it seemed There was no room for me Still I tried to change your mind  I guess I wanted you more And looking back now I'm sure I wanted you more I guess I wanted you more  Oh... I don't need you I don't need you anymore  I guess I wanted you more And looking back now I'm sure I wanted you more I guess I wanted you more  I don't need you I don't need you anymore
I dropped you off Just a little after midnight Sat in my car Till you turned off your porch light I should have kissed you I should have pushed you up against the wall I should have kissed you Just like I wasn't scared at all  I turned off the car Ran through the yard Back to your front door Before I could knock You turned the lock  And met me on the front porch  And I kissed you Goodnight  And now that I've kissed you It's a good night good night baby goodnight  You couldn't see me Watching through the window Wondering what went wrong Praying that you wouldn't go You should have kissed me  You should have pushed me up against the wall You should have kissed me I was right on the edge and ready to fall  So I turned off the car Ran through the yard  Back to your front door Before I could knock You turned the lock And met me on the front porch  And I kissed you Goodnight And now that I've kissed you It's a good night good night baby goodnight  I turned off the car ran through the yard back to your front door I was scared to death Can't catch my breath Aren't these the moments we live for And I kissed you Goodnight And now that I've kissed you It's a good night good night baby goodnight It's a good night good night baby goodnight It's a good night good night baby goodnight It's a good night good night baby goodnight
Trying to live and love, With a heart that can't be broken, Is like trying to see the light with eyes that can't be opened. Yeah, we both carry baggage, We picked up on our way, so if you love me do it gently, And I will do the same.  We may shine, we may shatter, We may be picking up the pieces here on after, We are fragile, we are human, We are shaped by the light we let through us, We break fast, cause we are glass. Cause we are glass.  I'll let you look inside me, through the stains and through the cracks, And in the darkness of this moment, You see the good and bad. But try not to judge me, 'cause we've walked down different paths, But it brought us here together, so I won't take that back.  We may shine, we may shatter, We may be picking up the pieces here on after, We are fragile, we are human, We are shaped by the light we let through us, We break fast, cause we are glass.  We might be oil and water, this could be a big mistake, We might burn like gasoline and fire, It's a chance we'll have to take.  We may shine, we may shatter, We may be picking up the pieces here on after, We are fragile, we are human, And we are shaped by the light we let through us, We break fast, cause we are glass. We are glass.
The sky in Cheyenne, Wyoming Is just about as blue as it gets And if you ain't seen a Santa Fe sunset You ain't seen red  Texas sunflower yellow Can take your breath away I've seen it all, from the orange of the fall To the green of the summer but my favorite color is  Neon The light they always leave on A weekend on the rocks An old school jukebox With a little Johnny Lee on  The buzz I love to be on You put a double on your troubles The light at this end of the tunnel Is neon  The sun can do the job in the daytime But the moon ain't quite bright enough To light up the way to playtime For people like us  Just like a beach side beacon Callin' all the ships back home A few thousand volts to cut through the smoke The windows are tinted that's why they invented  Neon The light they always leave on A weekend on the rocks An old school jukebox With a little Johnny Lee on  It's the buzz I love to be on You put a double on your troubles The light at this end of the tunnel Is always neon  You know I've seen it all From the orange of the fall To the green of the summer But my favorite color is Neon The light they always leave on Put a double on your troubles The light at this end of the tunnel Is neon

Everything to know about me  Is written on this page  The number you can reach me  My social and my age  Yes I served in the army  It's where I learned to shoot  Eighteen months in the desert  Pourin' sand out of my boots  No I've never been convicted of a crime  I could start this job at any time.  I got a strong back  Steel toes  I rarely call in sick  A good truck  What I don't know  I catch on real quick  I work weekends  If I have to  Nights and holidays  Give you 40  And then some  Whatever it takes  Four dollars and change at the pump  Cost of livin's high and goin' up.  I put Robert down as a reference  He's known me all my life  We attend the same church  He introduced me to my wife  Gave my last job everything  Before it headed south  Took the shoes off of my children's feet The food out of their mouths Yesterday my folks offered to help But they're barely getting by themselves I got a strong back Steel toes I rarely call in sick A good truck What I don't know I catch on real quick I work weekends If I have to Nights and holidays Give you 40 And then some Whatever it takes Four dollars and change at the pump Cost of livin's high and goin' up. I'm sure a hundred others have applied Rumor has it you're only takin' five I got a strong back Steel toes I'm handy with a wrench There's nothing I can't drive Nothing I can't fix I work sun-up to sun-down Ain't too proud to sweep the floors Bank has started calling And the wolves are at my door Four dollars and change at the pump Cost of livin's high and goin' up.

Fish, she wants to do it all the time Early in the morning, in the middle of the night She's hooked and now she can't get enough Man, that girl sure loves to fish  After that that's all she wanted to do But that was okay 'cause I did too She always wants to go down by the dam And I love how she looks with that rod in her hand If they ain't bitin' she don't give up Turns out my baby loves to...

Gonna put the the world away for a minute Pretend I don't live in it Sunshine gonna wash my blues away  Had sweet love but I lost it She got too close so I fought her Now I'm lost in the world trying to find me a better way  Wishing I was knee deep in the water somewhere Got the blue sky breeze and it don't seem fair Only worry in the world is the tide gonna reach my chair Sunrise there's a fire in the sky Never been so happy Never felt so high And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise  Wrote a note said be back in a minute Bought a boat and I sailed off in it Don't think anybody gonna miss me anyway  Mind on a permanent vacation The ocean is my only medication Wishing my condition ain't ever gonna go away  Cause now im knee deep in the water somewhere Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair Only worry in the world is the tide gonna reach my chair Sunrise there's a fire in the sky Never been so happy Never felt so high And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise  This champagne shore washing over me It's a sweet sweet life living by the salty sea One day you could be as lost as me Change you're geography Maybe you might be  Knee deep in the water somewhere Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair Only worry in the world is the tide gonna reach my chair Sunrise there's a fire in the sky Never been so happy Never felt so high And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise  Come on in the water it's nice Find yourself a little slice Grab a backpack of lies You never know until you try When you lose yourself You find the key to paradise
Don't worry, baby, sometimes things change Nothin' we can do about it now, no way This doesn't come easy, but that's just life We can't keep pretendin' everything's alright  We told each other it was love before The simple truth is it just ain't no more The bells stop ringin', the music won't play The crazy little feelin' that's faded away  Like snowflakes when the weather warms up Like leaves on the trees when the autumn comes Like the dogwood blossoms in a late spring rain All the disappearin' bubbles in a glass of champagne  Like a red kite lost in a blue sky wind I don't know where the good times end when It ain't nothin' we ever said or ever did wrong It's just love done gone  I don't regret a single thing that we did Anytime together, we ever spent I wouldn't change a thing, baby, you know Sometimes we gotta just go with the flow  Like snowflakes when the weather warms up Like leaves on the trees when the autumn comes Like the dogwood blossoms in a late spring rain All the disappearin' bubbles in a glass of champagne  Like money in a slot machine Don't know what happened to you and me It ain't nothin' we ever said or ever did wrong It's just love done gone It's just love done gone It's just love done gone

He smiled and said, "Yeah, son, I did"  But life's not the breath you take, the breathing in and out That gets you through the day, ain't what it's all about You just might miss the point trying to win the race Life's not the breaths you take but the moments that take your breath away  Fast forward fifteen years and a thousand miles away Boy's built a life, he's got a wife and a baby due today He hears a voice saying, "I made it son" Says, "I told you dad, you didn't have to come" He smiles and says, "Yeah, I know you did"  But life's not the breath you take, the breathing in and out That gets you through the day, ain't what it's all about You just might miss the point trying to win the race Life's not the breaths you take but the moments that take your breath away  Just like it took my breath when she was born Just like it took my breath away when dad took his last that morn Life's not the breath you take, the breathing in and out That gets you through the day, ain't what it's all about Just might miss the point if you don't slow down the pace Life's not the breaths you take but the moments that take your breath away

I laid there feeling sorry for myself In a bed of Kleenex Stuffing chocolates in my mouth On the phone with my best friend Cussing my ex He broke my heart Felt like the world had ended I cried myself to sleep Thinking I can't get over him Strange, talk about luck I woke up and the sun was shining Strange, I ought to be in bed With my head in the pillow crying Over us, but I ain't, ain't love Strange Got half a mind To spend my whole pay check On one of those dresses The strapless black ones That are so famous For teaching lessons Drop by his place Pick up the rest of my things He'll tell me I look good I'll laugh and say, now isn't time Strange, talk about luck I woke up and the sun was shining Strange, I ought to be in bed With my head in the pillow crying Over us, but I ain't, ain't love Strange, strange Strange, talk about luck I woke up and the sun was shining Strange, I ought to be in bed With my head in the pillow crying Over us, but I ain't, ain't love Strange Strange, talk about luck I woke up and the sun was shining Strange, strange

It's a high school prom It's a Springsteen song It's a welcome home parade It's a man on the moon And fireflies in June Kids sellin lemonade It's cities and farms And open arms One nation under God It's America

On a three hour flight from Memphis to L.A. I was silently celebrating my first-class upgrade Laughing at my jeans and my boots Beside those high dollar shoes and Armani suits  When the gentleman next to me said the drinks up here are free So, if you'd like the first one can be on me He said, I'm heading back from business in New York and Rome Tell me son, where do you call home?  I said, I'm from the front pew of a wooden white church A court house clock that still don't work Where a man's word means everything Where moms and dads were high school flames Gave their children grandmothers' maiden name Yes, it may not sound like much But that's where I'm from  So we drank that round and then another There wasn't a topic in this world we did not cover He said, I headed out west when I was barley nineteen Just a kid, chasing my dreams  And I said, I'm flying out here to pick up my big brother He's been fighting the cancer they discovered But he called last night, and said I think this is the end So come take me home to my family an my friends  Where the quarterback dates the homecoming queen The trucks are Ford and the tractors green And amazing grace is what we'd sing Where there's a county fair every fall And your friends are there no matter when you call Yeah it may not sound like much But it's where I'm from  And as we stood to claim the bags we checked He said I'll pray for your bother and did I mention That Italian suits haven't always been my style? See I was the quarterback of my high school team We took state back in '63 And my wife well, she still my home coming queen  Cause I'm from the front pew of a wooden white church A court house clock that still don't work Where a man's word means everything Where moms and dads were high school flames Gave their children grandmothers' maiden name Yes it may not sound like much I said it may not sound like much But it's where I'm from It's where I'm from It's where I'm from
Suppose I called you up tonight And told you that I loved you And suppose I said I wanna come back home And suppose I cried and said I think I finally learned my lesson And I'm tired of spendin' all my time alone  If I told you that I realized you're all I ever wanted And it's killin' me to be so far away Would you tell me that you love me too And would we cry together Or would you simply laugh at me and say  I told you so, Oh I told you so I told you some day you would come crawlin' back And askin' me to take you in I told you so, but you had to go Now I've found somebody new And you will never break my heart in two again  If I got down on my knees And told you I was yours forever Would you get down on yours too and take my hand  Would we get that old-time feeling Would we laugh and talk for hours  The way we did when out love first began Would you tell me that you've missed me too And that you've been so lonely And you've waited for the day that I returned  And we'd live and love forever And that I'm your one and only Or would you say the tables finally turned  Would you say��_  I told you so, Oh I told you so I told you some day you would come crawlin' back And askin' me to take you in I told you so, but you had to go Now I've found somebody new And you will never break my heart in two again  Now I've found somebody new And you will never break my heart in two again

At the ripe old age of nineteen I bought a short bed pick up chicks machine life ran on beer and gasoline a half a lap ahead of the law I had a fake I'd that got me into "tuffies" love was a word I used to get lucky was a big time spender with that plastic money back when I knew it all  Back when the World was flat and mama and daddy didn't have a clue that was back back when a pitcher of beer and a couple shots made me bulletproof back when God was a name I used in vain to get a point across when I got ticked off Lord, I'm learning so much more than back when I knew it all  I found out credit cards don't mean you're rich and beer and gasoline don't mix Yeah, step side trucks can't jump a ditch And those "big house" rooms sure are small I've learned that love is a woman that will settle you down a Sunday sermon can turn life around man I can't believe all the answers I've found since, back when I knew it all  Back when the world was flat and mama and daddy didn't have a clue That was back back when a pitcher of beer, and a couple shots made me bulletproof back when God was a name I used in vain to get a point across when I got ticked off Lord, I'm learning so much more than back when I knew it all  I've done some growing up and I'm still growing up so I know I'll never be as smart as I once was that was back  Back when the World was flat and mama and daddy didn't have a clue that was back Back when a pitcher of beer and a couple shots made me bulletproof back when God was a name I used in vain to get a point across when I got ticked off Lord, I'm learning so much more than back when I knew it all
I move on like a sinner's prayer Lettin' go like a levee brakes Walk away as if I don't care Learn to shoulder my mistakes I'm built to fade like your favorite song Get reckless when there's no need Laugh as your stories ramble on Break my heart, but it won't bleed  My only friends are pirates It's just who I am Well, I'm better as a memory Than as your man  I'm never sure when the truth won't do I'm pretty good on a lonely night I move on the way the storm blows through I never stay but then again I might I struggle sometimes to find the words Always sure until I doubt Walk a line until it blurs Build walls too high to climb out  But I'm honest to a fault It's just who I am I'm better as a memory Than as you man  I see you leaning You're bound to fall Well, I don't want to be that mistake I'm just a dreamer, nothing more You should know it before it gets too late  'Cause goodbyes are like a roulette wheel You never know where they're gonna land First you're spinning then your standin' still Left holdin' a losing hand But one day your gonna find someone And right away you'll know it's true That all of your seekin's done It's just a part of the passing through Right there in that moment You'll finally understand That I was better as a memory, than as your man Better as a memory, than as your man
When you see a deer, you see Bambi And I see antlers up on the wall When you see a lake, you think picnics And I see a largemouth up under that log  You're probably thinking that you're gonna change me In some ways well, maybe you might Scrub me down, dress me up Ah but no matter what Remember I'm still a guy  When you see a priceless French painting I see a drunk naked girl You think that riding a wild bull sounds crazy And I'd like to give it a whirl Well, love makes a man do some things he ain't proud of And in a weak moment I might Walk your sissy dog, hold your purse at the mall But remember I'm still a guy  And I'll pour out my heart Hold your hand in the car Write a love song that makes you cry Then turn right around Knock some jerk to the ground 'cause he copped a feel as you walked by  I can hear you now talking to your friends Saying, "Yeah girls he's come a long way" From dragging his knuckles and carrying a club And building a fire in a cave But when you say a backrub means only a backrub Then you swat my hand when I try Well now what can I say at, the end of the day Honey, I'm still a guy  And I'll pour out my heart Hold your hand in the car Write a love song that makes you cry Then turn right around Knock some jerk to the ground 'cause he copped a feel as you walked by  These days there's dudes getting facials Manicured, waxed, and botoxed With deep spray on tans and creamy, lotioney hands You can't grip a tackle box  Yeah with all of these men lining up to get neutered It's hip now to be feminized But I don't highlight my hair I've still got a pair Yeah honey, I'm still a guy My eyebrows ain't plucked There's a gun in my truck Oh thank God I'm still a guy
We headed out to California Everybody tried to warn us Said we wouldn't make it any further Than that worn out Chevy would  We broke down a time or two Thought "maybe we didn't think it through" We were all we had to turn to When it wasn't lookin' good  We're lookin' back laughin' 'cause they called us crazy  (chorus) We were young, we were wild, we were restless Had to go, had to fly - had to get away Took a chance on that feelin' - baby We were lovin' blind - borderline reckless We were livin' for the minute we were spinnin' in Maybe we were a lot of things But we weren't crazy  Just a couple kids a couple years ago Now we gotta couple kids of our own We turn out right - proved them wrong Look at us goin' strong  Lookin' back laughin' 'cause they called us crazy  (repeat chorus)  Coulda set it down When things got tough Coulda walked away from this love But that'd been crazy  We were young, we were wild, we were restless Had to go, had to fly, had to get away Took a chance on that feeling We were lovin blind, borderline reckless We were livin for the minute we were spinning in Maybe we were a lot of things Oh maybe we were a lot of things But we werent crazy We weren't crazy We weren't crazy
Got a guitar, got a guitar on my back And I'm standin' on this lonesome railroad track Train's a-comin', it'll be here 'fore too long But I don't think I can stop it with a song  Girl, that's kind of the way I'm feelin' Trying to stop your leaving  Got a pebble, got a pebble in my hand And I toss it out into the middle of the Rio Grande But the river keeps runnin', don't even know that I'm around I could throw in a million more and not slow it down  Girl, that's kind of the way I'm feelin' Trying to stop your leaving  There's nothin' I wouldn't try If I thought it would change your mind  But you don't love me, no, you don't love me anymore And I know as soon as you walk out that door Train's a-comin', river's runnin', train's a-comin', river's runnin' Pain's a-comin', tears are runnin'  And that's kind of the way I'm feelin' Knowin' I couldn't stop your leaving

I just can't say But I've, I've had that song in my head all day  I said, "How 'bout an autograph for your Your biggest fan?" You wrote your name and your number In the palm of my hand  My heart and that big bass speaker Were thumpin' away And I've had that song in my head all day  I don't know who sings it I keep searchin' the radio I just wanna hear it So I can watch that video  I got in my head of a blue-eyed boy Dancin' in the bed of a two-tone Ford Oh Lord, is it love? I just can't say  Don't know who sings it I keep searchin' the radio I just wanna hear it So I can watch that video  I got in my head of a blue-eyed boy Dancin' in the bed of a two-tone Ford Oh Lord, is it love?

Just walked down the street to the coffee shop Had to take a break I've been by her side for eighteen hours straight Saw a flower growing in the middle of the sidewalk Pushing up through the concrete Like it was planted right there for me to see  The flashing lights The honking horns All seem to fade away But in the shadow of that hospital At 5: 08 I saw God today  I've been to church I've read the book I know He's here But I don't look Near as often as I should Yeah, I know I should  His fingerprints are everywhere I just look down and stop and stare Open my eyes and then I swear I saw God today  Saw a couple walking by They were holding hands Man, she had that glow Ya, I couldn't help But notice she was starting to show Stood there for a minute Taking in the sky Lost in that sunset A splash of amber melting into shades of red  I've been to church I've read the book I know He's here But I don't look Near as often as I should Yeah, I know I should  His fingerprints are everywhere I just look down and stop and stare Open my eyes and then I swear I saw God today  Got my face pushed up against the nursery glass She's sleeping like a rock My name on her wrist Wearing tiny pink socks She's got my nose She's got her Mama's eyes My brand new baby girl, She's a miracle I saw God today

These are the days of the open hand They will not be the last Look around now These are the days of the beggars and the choosers  This is the year of the hungry man Whose place is in the past Hand in hand With ignorance and legitimate excuses  The rich declare themselves poor And most of us are not sure If we have too much but we'll take our chances 'Cause God's stopped keeping score  I guess somewhere along the way He must have let us all out to play Turned his back and all God's children Crept out the back door  And it's hard to love There's so much to hate Hanging on to hope When there is no hope to speak of  And the wounded skies above Say it's much too late Well maybe we should all be praying for time  This is the year of the empty hand Oh you hold on to what you can And charity is a coat you wear twice a year  These are the days of the guilty man Your television takes a stand And you find that what was over there is over here  So you scream from behind your door And say what's mine is mine and not yours I may have too much but I'll take my chances 'Cause God's stopped keeping score  And you cling to the things they sold you Did you cover your eyes when they told you That he can't come back? 'Cause he has no children to come back for  And it's hard to love When there's so much to hate Hanging on to hope When there is no hope to speak of  And the wounded skies above Say it's much, much too late Well maybe we should all be praying for time

I came to see her daddy For a sit down man to man It wasn't any secret I'd be asking for her hand  I guess that's why he  me waiting In the living room by myself With at least a dozen pictures of her Sitting on a shelf She was playing Cinderella She was riding her first bike  Bouncing on the bed And looking for a pillow fight Running through the sprinkler With a big popsicle grin Dancing with her dad Looking up at him In her eyes I'm Prince Charming  But to him I'm just some fella Riding in and stealing Cinderella I leaned in towards those pictures To get a better look at one When I heard a voice behind me say "Now, ain't she something, son?" I said, "Yes, she quite a woman" And he just stared at me  Then I realized that in his eyes She would always be Playing Cinderella Riding her first bike  Bouncing on the bed And looking for a pillow fight Running through the sprinkler With a big popsicle grin Dancing with her dad Looking up at him In her eyes I'm Prince Charming But to him I'm just some fella Riding in and stealing Cinderella Oh he slapped me on the shoulder Then he called her in the room When she threw her arms around him That's when I could see it too She was playing Cinderella Riding her first bike Bouncing on the bed And looking for a pillow fight Running through the sprinklers With a big popsicle grin Dancing with her dad Looking up at him If he gives me a hard time I can't blame the fella I'm the one who's stealing Cinderella

I have days where I hate my job This little town and the whole world too And last Sunday when my Panthers lost Lord, it put me in a bad mood  I have moments when I curse the rain Then complain when the sun's too hot I look around at what everyone has And I forget about all I've got  But I know I'm a lucky man God's given me a pretty fair hand Got a house and a piece of land A few dollars in a coffee can  My old trucks still running good My ticker's ticking like they say it should I got supper in the oven, a good woman's loving And one more day to be my little kid's dad Lord, knows I'm a lucky man  Got some friends who would be here fast I could call 'em any time of day Got a brother who's got my back Got a mama who I swears a saint  Got a brand new rod and reel Got a full week off this year Dad had a close call last spring It's a miracle he's still here  But I know I'm a lucky man God's given me a pretty fair hand Got a house and a piece of land A few dollars in a coffee can  My old trucks still running good My ticker's ticking like they say it should I got supper in the oven, a good woman's loving One more day to be my little kid's dad Lord, knows I'm a lucky man  Oh, my old trucks still running good My ticker's ticking like they say it should I got supper in the oven, a good woman's loving And even my bad days ain't that bad Yeah, I'm a lucky man, I'm a lucky, lucky man
Sometimes I think about you Wonder if you're out there somewhere thinking 'bout me And would you even recognize The woman that your little girl has grown up to be  'Cause I look in the mirror and all I see Are your brown eyes looking back at me They're the only thing you ever gave to me at all  Oh, I hear the weather's nice in California There's sunny skies as far as I can see If you ever come back home to Carolina I wonder what you'd say to me  ... I think about how it ain't fair That you weren't there to braid my hair like mothers do You weren't around to cheer me on  Help me dress for my high school prom like mothers do Did you think I didn't need you here? To hold my hand, to dry my tears?  Did you even miss me through the years at all? Oh, I hear the weather's nice in California There's sunny skies as far as I can see If you ever come back home to Carolina  I wonder what you'd say to me Forgiveness is such a simple word  But it's so hard to do when you've been hurt Oh, I hear the weather's nice in California And just in case you're wondering about me From now on I won't be in Carolina Your little girl is off, your little girl is off Your little girl is off to Tennessee ...
(Annie Tateu002FSam Tateu002FDave Berg)  I was coming to the end of a long, long walk When a man crawled out of a cardboard box Under the E. Street Bridge Followed me on to it I went out halfway across With that homeless shadow tagging along So I dug for some change Wouldn't need it anyway He took it lookin' just a bit ashamed He said, You know, I haven't always been this way  I've had my moments, days in the sun Moments I was second to none Moments when I knew I did what I thought I couldn't do Like that plane ride coming home from the war That summer my son was born And memories like a coat so warm A cold wind can't get through Lookin' at me now you might not know it But I've had my moments  I stood there tryin' to find my nerve Wondering if a single soul on Earth Would care at all Miss me when I'm gone That old man just kept hanging around Lookin' at me, lookin' down I think he recognized That look in my eyes Standing with him there I felt ashamed I said, You know, I haven't always been this way  I've had my moments, days in the sun Moments I was second to none Moments when I knew I did what I thought I couldn't do Like the day I walked away from the wine For a woman who became my wife And a love that, when it was right, Could always see me through Lookin' at me now you might not know it But I've had my moments  I know somewhere 'round a trashcan fire tonight That old man tells his story one more time He says  I've had my moments, days in the sun Moments I was second to none Moments when I knew I did what I thought I couldn't do Like that cool night on the E. Street Bridge When a young man almost ended it I was right there, wasn't scared a bit And I helped to pull him through Lookin' at me now you might not know it Oh, lookin' at me now you might not know it But I've had my moments  I've had my moments I've had my moments I've had my moments

Driving through town just my boy and me With a happy meal in his booster seat Knowing that he couldn't have the toy Till his nuggets were gone Green traffic light turned straight to red I hit my brakes and mumbled under my breath His fries went a flying and his orange drink covered his lap Well then my four year old said a four letter word That started with "s" and I was concerned So I said son now now where did you learn to talk like that  He said I've been watching you dad, ain't that cool  I'm your buckaroo, I wanna be like you And eat all my food and grow as tall as you are We got cowboy boots and camo pants Yeah we're just alike, hey ain't we dad I wanna do everything you do So I've been watching you We got back home and I went to the barn  I bowed my head and I prayed real hard Said lord please help me help my stupid self Then this side of bedtime later that night Turning on my son's scooby doo nightlight He crawled out of bed and he got down on his knees He closed his little eyes, folded his little hands And spoke to god like he was talking to a friend And I said son now where'd you learn to pray like that He said I've been watching you dad, ain't that cool  I'm your buckaroo, I wanna be like you  And eat all my food and grow as tall as you are We like fixing things and holding mama's hand Yeah we're just alike, hey ain't we dad I wanna do everything you do So I've been watching you With tears in my eyes I wrapped him in a hug Said my little bear is growing up  He said but when I'm big I'll still know what to do  Cause I've been watching you dad, ain't that cool I'm your buckaroo, I wanna be like you And eat all my food and grow as tall as you are By then I'll be as strong as superman We'll be just alike, hey won't we dad When I can do everything you do Cause I've been watching you.
My little girl met a new friend Just the other day On the playground at school Between the tires and the swings But she came home with tear-filled eyes And she said to me "Daddy, Alyssa Lies"  Well I just brushed it off at first Cause I didn't know how much my little girl had been hurt Or the things she had seen I wasn't ready when I said you can tell me And she said  Alyssa Lies To the classroom Alyssa lies Everyday at school Alyssa lies To the teachers As she tries to cover every bruise My little girl laid her head down  That night to go to sleep As I stepped out the room I heard her say A prayer so soft and sweet  God bless my mom and my dad And my new friend Alyssa I know she needs it bad Because Alyssa lies  To the classroom  Alyssa lies Every day at school Alyssa lies To the teachers  As she tries To cover every bruise I had the worst night of sleep in years As I tried to think of a way to calm her fears I knew just what it was I had to do  But when we got to school on Monday I heard the news My little girl asked me why everybody looked so sad The lump in my throat grew bigger With every question that she asked Until I felt the tears run down my face And I told her that Alyssa wouldn't be at school today She doesn't lie  In the classroom She doesn't lie Anymore at school Alyssa lies With Jesus Because there's nothing anyone would do Tears filled my eyes When my little girl asked me why Alyssa lies Oh Daddy Daddy tell me why Alyssa lies

Country Roads, old theatre marquee signs; Parkin' lots, and billboards flyin' by. Spanish mosques, little hick town squares; Wild roses on a river bank: girl its almost like you're there  Oh, every mile, a memory; every song, another scene, From some old movie going back in time you and me. Every day, a page turned down; every night, a lonesome sound, Like a freight train rollin' through my dreams: Every mile, a memory.  Red sun down, out across the western sky, Takes me back to the fire in your eyes. Texas stars in a purple night. Not seein' 'em with you baby: oh, they never do it right, no.  Every mile, a memory; every song, another scene, From some old movie going back in time you and me. Every day, a page turned down; every night, a lonesome sound, Like a freight train rollin' through my dreams: Every mile, a memory.  Funny how no matter where I run, Round every bend I only see, Just how far I haven't come.  Every mile, a memory; every song, another scene, From some old movie going back in time. Every day, a page turned down; every night, a lonesome sound, Like a freight train rollin' through my dreams: Every mile, a memory; Every mile, a memory; Every mile, a memory.

Would you go with me if we rolled down streets of fire Would you hold on to me tighter as the summer sun got higher If we roll from town to town and never shut it down  Would you go with me if we were lost in fields of clover Would we walk even closer until the trip was over And would it be okay if I didn't know the way  If I gave you my hand would you take it And make me the happiest man in the world If I told you my heart couldn't beat one more minute without you, girl Would you accompany me to the edge of the sea Let me know if you're really a dream I love you so, so would you go with me  Would you go with me if we rode the clouds together Could you not look down forever If you were lighter than a feather Oh, and if I set you free, would you go with me  If I gave you my hand would you take it And make me the happiest man in the world If I told you my heart couldn't beat one more minute without you, girl Would you accompany me to the edge of the sea Help me tie up the ends of a dream I gotta know, would you go with me I love you so, so would you go with me

Life ain't always beautiful Sometimes it's just plain hard Life can knock you down, it can break your heart  Life ain't always beautiful You think you're on your way And it's just a dead end road at the end of the day  But the struggles makes you stronger And the changes make you wise And happiness has its own way of takin' its sweet time  No, life ain't always beautiful Tears will fall sometimes Life ain't always beautiful, but it's a beautiful ride  Life ain't always beautiful Some days I miss your smile I get tired of walkin' all these lonely miles  And I wish for just one minute I could see your pretty face Guess I can dream, but life don't work that way  But the struggles makes me stronger And the changes make me wise And happiness has its own way of takin' its sweet time  No, life ain't always beautiful But I know I'll be fine Hey, life ain't always beautiful, but its a beautiful ride What a beautiful ride

Fin'lly got over that song of ours; stopped chasin' little red sports cars, To check the license plates an' back wood drivin' by your place. Back makin' the rounds at our old haunts: Honky Tonks, restaurants. An' seein' some of our old friends: it feels good to dance again. An' I can fin'lly smell your perfume an' not look around the room for you. An' I can walk right by your picture in a frame an' not feel a thing.  But when I hear your name, I feel rain fallin' right out of the blue sky. An' it's the fifth of May, an' I'm right there starin' in your eyes. An' nothin's changed, an' we're still same. An' I get lost in the innocence of a first kiss, An' I'm hangin' on to every word rollin' off of your lips: An' that's all it takes, an' I'm in that place, Every time I hear your name.  Got someone special in my life: everyone thinks she'd make a great wife. Dad says he thinks she's the one: reminds him of Mom when she was young, But it's way too soon to be talkin 'bout rings; don't wanna rush into anything. She's getting over someone too, kinda like me an' you. An' she talks about him every once in a while, an' I just nod my head an' smile, 'Cause I know exactly what she's goin' through: yeah, I've been there too.  An' when the conversation turns to you, I get caught in a "you were the only one for me", Kinda thought, an' your face is all that I see. I know I can't go back but I still go back. An' there we are, a point down by the riverside, An' I'm in your arms about to make love for the first time, An' that's all it takes, an' I'm in that place, Every time I hear your name.  So I'm thinkin' 'bout the words I left unsaid. (Every time I hear your name.) Stop tryin' the change the things I can't change. (Every time I hear your name.) In my heart I know you're gone, but in my head,  I feel rain fallin' right out of the blue sky. An' it's the fifth of May, an' I'm right there starin' in your eyes. That's all it takes, an' I'm in that place. An' there we are, a point down by the riverside, An' I'm in your arms about to make love for the first time. An' I can't explain, but I'm in that place, Every time I hear your name. Every time I hear your name. (Every time I hear your name.) Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. (Every time I hear your name.) Ah ah. Every time I hear your name.
Eighteen years had come and gone For Momma they flew by But for me they drug on and on  We were loadin' up that Chevy Both tryin' not to cry Momma kept on talkin', puttin' off goodbye Then she took my hand and said Baby don't forget.  Before you hit the highway You better stop for gas And there's a fifty in the ashtray In case you run short on cash.  Here's a map and a Bible If you ever lose your way Just one more thing before you leave Don't forget to remember me.  This downtown apartment Sure makes me miss home And those bills there on the counter Keep tellin' me I'm on my own.  And just like every Sunday I called Mama up last night And even when it's not I tell her everything's all right Before we hung up I said Hey Mama don't forget.  To tell my baby sister I'll see her in the fall And tell Mee-Ma that I miss her Yeah I should give her a call.  And make sure you tell daddy That I'm still his little girl Yeah I still feel like I'm where I'm supposed to be But don't forget to remember me.  Tonight I find myself kneelin' by the bed to pray I haven't done this in a while So I don't know what to say.  But Lord I feel so small sometimes In this big old place. Yeah I know there's more important things, But don't forget to remember me Don't forget to remember me.

I just left Bobby's house: The service was today. Got me thinkin' about how fragile life is, As I drove away. You know Amy was his only love, In a moment she was gone, long gone: It could have been me or you. Oh, baby, there's no time to lose.  So I'm gonna bring home a dozen roses, An' pour us a glass of wine. An' I'm gonna put on a little music, An' turn down the lights. An' I'm gonna wrap my arms around you, An' rock you all through the night, An' I'm gonna love you, Like it's the last day of my life.  I drive off when the sun comes up: I get back when it's gone down. There's so much I wanna do with you, But I can't be around. Whoa, time has been just like a thief, It's stolen too much from us, So once it's gone we can't make it up. So tonight, let's get back in touch.    I'm gonna bring home a dozen roses, An' pour us a glass of wine. An' I'm gonna put on a little music, An' turn down the lights. An' I'm gonna wrap my arms around you, An' rock you all through the night, An' I'm gonna love you, Like it's the last day of my...  Life is a rainbow, it's a spring snow, It's the mornin' dew. An' I don't wanna waste another minute, Without you.  So I'm gonna bring home a dozen roses, An' pour us a glass of wine. An' I'm gonna put on a little music, An' turn down the lights. An' I'm gonna wrap my arms around you, An' rock you all through the night, An' I'm gonna love you, Like it's the last day of my life. I'm gonna love you, Like it's the last day of my life. Oh, oh.
I know where I come from How 'bout you? I don't need baggy clothes Or rings in my nose to be cool  The scars on my knuckles Match these scuffs on these cowboy boots An' there's a whole lot more like me How 'bout you?  I punch the clock tryin' to make it to the top How 'bout you? I ain't got no blue-blood trust fund I can dip in to  Yeah, I wish uncle Sam would give a damn About the man whose collar's blue But if he don't, hell, I'll make it on my own How 'bout you?  An' how 'bout you? Do you feel the way I do? To tell the truth I think we're the chosen few But that's just me, how 'bout you?  I still say, "Yes, Ma'am", to my momma How 'bout you? If I shake your hand, look you in the eye You can bet your ass, it'll be the truth  I cover my heart with my hat When they fly that red, white and blue Just like my daddy taught me How 'bout you?  An' how 'bout you? Do you feel the way I do? To tell the truth I think we're the chosen few But that's just me, how 'bout you?  I like my country rockin' How 'bout you? Just put me on a stage, man Turn it up an' I'll turn it loose  Yeah, give me a crowd that's redneck an' loud We'll raise the roof Yeah, I might just stay all night long How 'bout you?  Do you feel the way I do? To tell the truth I think we're the chosen few An' how 'bout you? Do you feel the way I do?  'Cause, man, I know where I come from How 'bout you?
It's 3 A.M. and I finally say I'm sorry for actin that way I didn't really mean to make you cry Oh baby, sometimes I wonder why  Does it always have to come down to you leavin Before I'll say I love you? And why do I always use the words that cut the deepest When I know how much it hurts you? Oh baby why, do I do that to you?  Well I know I'd never let you walk away So why do I push you til you break And why are you always on the verge of good-bye Before I'll show you how I really feel inside  Why does it always have to come down to you leavin before I'll say I love you? And why do I always use the words that cut the deepest When I know how much it hurts you? Oh baby why, do I do that to you?

I feel no shame I'm proud of where I came from I was born and raised in the boondocks  One thing I know No matter where I go I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks  And I can feel That muddy water running through my veins And I can hear that lullaby of a midnight train And it sings to me and it sounds familiar  I feel no shame I'm proud of where I came from I was born and raised in the boondocks  One thing I know No matter where I go I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks  And I can taste That honeysuckle and it's still so sweet When it grows wild On the banks down at old camp creek Yeah, and it calls to me like a warm wind blowing  I feel no shame I'm proud of where I came from I was born and raised in the boondocks  One thing I know No matter where I go I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks  It's where I learned about living It's where I learned about love It's where I learned about working hard And having a little was just enough  It's where I learned about Jesus And knowing where I stand You can take it or leave it This is me, this is who I am  Give me a tin roof A front porch and a gravel road And that's home to me It feels like home to me  I feel no shame I'm proud of where I came from I was born and raised in the boondocks  One thing I know No matter where I go I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks  You get a line, I get a pole We'll go fishing in the crawfish hole Five card poker on Saturday night Church on Sunday morning  You get a line, I get a pole (You get a line, I get a pole) We'll go fishing (We'll go fishing in the crawfish hole) Down in the boondocks (Five card poker on Saturday night) Church on Sunday morning  You get a line, I get a pole (You get a line, I get a pole) We'll go fishing (We'll go fishing in the crawfish hole) Down in the boondocks (Five card poker on Saturday night) (Say a little prayer for me) Church on Sunday morning You get a line, I get a pole (You get a line, I get a pole) We'll go fishing (We'll go fishing in the crawfish hole) Down in the boondocks (Five card poker on Saturday night) (Say a little prayer for me) Church on Sunday morning  Sing "I get a line" etc. 3 times more
Written by Dean Dillon and Kerry Kurt Phil  He wondered how she'd take it when he said goodbye. Thought she might do some cryin': lose some sleep at night. But he had no idea, when he hit the road, That without him in her life, she'd let herself go.  Let herself go on a singles cruise, To Vegas once, then to Honolulu. Let herself go to New York City: A week at the Spa; came back knocked-out pretty. When he said he didn't love her no more, She let herself go.  Instrumental break.  She poured her heart an' soul into their three-bedroom ranch. Spent her days raisin' babies, ironin' his pants. Came home one day from the grocery store and found his note, And without him there to stop her, she let herself go.  Let herself go on her first blind-date: Had the time of her life with some friends at the lake. Let herself go, buy a brand new car, Drove down to the beach he always said was too far. Sand sure felt good between her toes:  She let herself go on a singles cruise, To Vegas once, then to Honolulu. Let herself go to New York City: A week at the Spa; came back knocked-out pretty. When he said he didn't love her no more, She let herself go.  To Vegas once: Honolulu, New York City. Came back knocked-out pretty.  To Fade.
A woman is a mystery A man just can't understand Sometimes all it takes to please her Is the touch of your hand  An' other times you gotta take it slow An' hold her all night long Heaven knows there's so many ways A man can go wrong  Must be doin' somethin' right I just heard ya sigh Ya lean into my kiss and close Those deep blue need-you eyes  Don't know what I did To earn a love like this But baby, I Must be doin' somethin' right  Anywhere you wanna go Baby show me the way I'm open to suggestions Mm, whatever you say  Tonight's about givin' you what you want Whatever it takes Girl I hope I'm on the right road Judgin' by the smile on your face  Must be doin' somethin' right I just heard ya sigh Ya lean into my kiss and close Those deep blue need-you eyes  Don't know what I did To earn a love like this But baby, I Must be doin' somethin' right  Oh baby, mm-mm  Don't know what I did To earn a love like this But baby, I Must be doin' somethin' right  Must be doin' somethin' right Oh yeah Must be doin' somethin' ri-i-ight Must be doin' somethin' ri-ight  Don't know what I did (Don't know what I did) Must be doin' somethin' right, uh huh Must be doin' somethin' right
My old friend, I recall The times we had hanging on my wall I wouldn't trade them for gold Cause they laugh and they cry me Somehow sanctify me They're woven in the stories I have told And tell again  My old friend, I apologize For the years that have passed Since the last time you and I Dusted off those memories But the running and the races The people and the places There's always somewhere else I had to be Time gets thin, my old friend  Don't know why, don't know why Don't know why, don't know why  My old friend, this song's for you Cause a few simple verses Was the least that I could do To tell the world that you were here Cause the love and the laughter Will live on long after All of the sadness and the tears We'll meet again, my old friend  Goodbye, goodbye Goodbye, goodbye  My old friend, my old friend Goodbye, goodbye
Cowboys Are Frequently Secretly (Fond of Each Other)  Well, there's many a strange impulse out on the plains of West Texas. There's many a young boy who feels things he can't comprehend. And a small town don't like it when somebody falls between sexes. No, a small town don't like it when a cowboy has feelings for men.  And I believe to my soul that inside every man there's the feminine. And inside every lady there's a deep manly voice loud and clear. Well, a cowboy may brag about things that he's done with his women. But the ones who brag loudest are the ones that are most likely queer.  Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other. Say, what do you think all them saddles and boots was about? And there's many a cowboy who don't understand the way that he feels for his brother. And inside every cowboy there's a lady that'd love to slip out.  And there's always somebody who says what the others just whisper. And mostly that someone's the first one to get shot down dead. So when you talk to a cowboy don't treat him like he was a sister. You can't f**k with a lady that's sleepin' in each cowboy's head.  Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other. What did you think all them saddles and boots was about? And there's many a cowboy who don't understand the way that he feels for his brother. And inside every lady there's a cowboy who wants to come out. And inside every cowboy there's a lady that'd love to slip out.

Sunny days seem to hurt the most I wear the pain like a heavy coat I feel you everywhere I go I see your smile, I see your face I hear you laughin' in the rain I still can't believe you're gone  It ain't fair you died too young Like a story that had just begun But death tore the pages all away God knows how I miss you All the hell that I've been through Just knowin', no one could take your place Sometimes I wonder who you'd be today  Would you see the world? Would you chase your dreams? Settle down with a family I wonder what would you name your babies?  Some days the sky's so blue I feel like I can talk to you And I know it might sound crazy  It ain't fair you died too young Like a story that had just begun But death tore the pages all away  God knows how I miss you All the hell that I've been through Just knowin', no one could take your place Sometimes I wonder who you'd be today  Today. Today. Today.  Today. Today. Today.  Sunny days seem to hurt the most I wear the pain like a heavy coat The only thing that gives me hope Is I know I'll see you again someday Someday, someday
From the hills of Kaycee, Wyoming Where life's wooly and wild There's an Air Force brat in a cowboy hat And that Copenhagen smile And from buckin' broncs to honky tonks He always sang a cowboy's song We were much too young, havin' too much fun As we all sang along  We sang Life's a Highway There's only one way you're gonna get through it When she starts to twist be more like Chris Pull your hat down tight And just LeDoux it! When that whistle blows And that crowd explodes And them pickup men are at your side They tell you good ride cowboy, good ride  From gold buckles to gold records Once again he was spinnin' 'round Took the whole world on And he turned us on to that Western Underground And from Bareback Jack to This Cowboy's Hat The songs were stronger than his pain He would not slow down from town to town Like children running thru the rain  We sang Life's a Highway There's only one way you're gonna get through it When she starts to twist be more like Chris Pull your hat down tight And just LeDoux it! When that whistle blows And that crowd explodes And them pickup men are at your side They tell you good ride cowboy, good ride  We sang Life's a Highway There's only one way you're gonna get through it When she starts to twist be more like Chris Pull your hat down tight And just LeDoux it! When that whistle blows And that crowd explodes And them pickup men are at your side They tell you good ride cowboy, good ride  When we cross that river Jordan, With St Peter on the other side Singin' Good Ride Cowboy, Good Ride! Say Good Ride Cowboy, Good Ride!

Sarabeth is scared to death To hear what the doctor will say She hasn't been well, since the day that she fell And the bruise, it just won't go away  So she sits and she waits with her mother and dad And flips through an old magazine Till the nurse with the smile stands in the door And says "Will you please come with me?"  Sarabeth is scared to death 'cause the doctor just told her the news "Between the red cells and white, something's not right But we're gonna take care of you  Six chances in ten, it won't come back again With the therapy we're gonna try It's just been approved, it's the strongest there is And I think that we caught it in time." And Sarabeth closes her eyes.  And she dreams she's dancing Around and around without any cares And her very first love is holding her close And a soft wind is blowing her hair  Sarabeth is scared to death As she sits holding her mom 'cause it would be a mistake for someone to take A girl with no hair to the prom  For just this morning, right here on her pillow Was the cruelest of any surprise And she cried when she gathered it all in her hands The proof that she couldn't deny And Sarabeth closes her eyes  And she dreams she's dancing Around and around without any cares And her very first love is holding her close And a soft wind is blowing her hair  It's quarter to seven, that boy's at the door And her daddy ushers him in And when he takes off his cap They all start to cry 'cause this morning where his hair had all been Softly she touches just skin  And they go dancing, around and around Without any cares And her very first true love is holding her close And for a moment she isn't scared
So you sailed away into a grey sky morning Now I'm here to stay, love can be so boring And nothing's quite the same now I just say your name now  But it's not so bad You're only the best I ever had You don't want me back You're just the best I ever had  So you stole my world, now I'm just a phony Remembering the girl leaves me down and lonely We'll send it in a letter Make yourself feel better  But it's not so bad You're only the best I ever had You don't want me back You're just the best I ever had  And it might take some time to patch me up inside But I can't take it so I, I run away and hide And I might find in time that you were always right You're always right  So you sailed away into a grey sky morning Now, I'm here to stay, love can be so boring Was it what you wanted? Could it be I'm haunted? But it's not so bad You're only the best I ever had You don't want me back You're just the best I ever had You're just the best I ever had
(Toby Keithu002FScotty Emerick)  See that big blue note, Over there on the counter? You don't wanna read that thing, man, It's a real get-you-downer. But don't you dare say nothin' else, Bad about her: she's gone.  No, no, no, no, don't, don't throw it away, 'Cause tonight, I might need it. It gets real lonely around here at night some times, An' I have to read read it. Besides, you can show it to the boys down town, They won't believe that she's gone.  There used to be a time I was all she ever wanted. All the man that she'll ever need. I come home to find, just like that, she's up an' vanished. An' the only thing she left behind for me:  Is this big blue note, Folded up in my pocket. Yeah, don't laugh: it's been two months; I still got it. Sometimes I have to read the sucker twice, Just to make sure I ain't forgot that she's gone.  You know, my psychiatrist said: "Tell me, what do you see, "When you look at these inkspots, "Of, er, reds, yellows an' greens?" You know, I looked at 'em all, But they all looked to me like big blue notes.  There used to be a time I was all she ever wanted. All the man that she'll ever need. I come home to find, just like that, she's up an' vanished. An' the only thing that's left to do for me:  Is stand high on this cliff, Overlooking the sea. With my big blue notepaper aeroplane, That I just set free. An' I'm gonna wait here a few more minutes, An' if it don't come back to me: You guessed it: she's gone.  Crash landing. Bye bye, baby.
There's a story that my daddy tells religiously Like clockwork every time he see's an opening In a conversation, 'bout the way things use to be.  I just roll my eyes and make a beeline for the door I'd always end up starry eyed and cross legged on the floor Hanging onto every word; man, the things I heard  It was harder times and longer days Five miles to school uphill both ways We were cane switched raised and dirt floor poor Course that was back before the war Yea your uncle and I made quit a pair Flying F-15's through hostile air He went down but they missed me by a hair He'd always stop right there and say  That's something to be proud of That's a life you can hang your hat on as your chins held high as the tears fall down gut sucked in, chest stuck out Like a small town flag a flying Or a new born baby crying In the arms of the woman that you love That's something to be proud of  Son graduating college, that was momma's dream And I was on my way to anywhere else when I turned Eighteen that's when you got a fast car, and think you got everything  I learned real quick those GTO's don't run off faith I ended up broke down in some town north of L.A. Working maximum hours, for minimum wage  I fell in love next thing I know Babies came and the car got sold Sure do miss that old Hot Rod But you sure save gas in them foreign jobs Dad I wonder if I ever let you down If you're ashamed how I turned out Well he lowered his voice, then he raised his brow Said let me tell you right now  That's something to be proud of That's a life you can hang your hat on No need to make a million just be thankful to be working If you're doing what you're able Putting food there on the table And providing for the family that you love That's something to be proud of  And if all you ever really do is the best you can... Well, you did it man  That's something to be proud of That's a life you can hang your hat on As your chins held high as the tears fall down gut sucked in, chest stuck out Like a small town flag a flying Or a new born baby crying In the arms of the woman that you love That's something to be proud of That's something to be proud of That's something to be proud of That's something to be proud of Now that's something to be proud of

Written by Kip Raines and Jeffrey Steele  Well, Grandaddy was a hillbilly scholar, blue collar of a man. He came from the school where you didn't need nothin', If you couldn't make it with your own two hands. He was backwoods, backwards, used words like: "No Sir," "Yes, Ma'am," "By God," "Be darned," "Hell yeah, I'm American." In all the years he walked this earth, I swear all he did was work. He said: "The devil dreams on an idle horse, "So you listen to me squirt.  "Don't get too high on the bottle, And get right with the Man. Fight your fights, find a grace, And all the things that you can change, And help somebody if you can."  Now Granny said: "Sonny, stick to your ganas, If you believe in something, no matter what, 'Cause it's better to be hated for who you are, Than be loved for who you're not." She was five feet of concrete New York born an' raised on a slick city street. She'd cold-stare you down, stand her ground, Still kickin' and screamin' at 93. I remember just how frail she looked in that hospital bed: Takin' her last few breaths of life, smilin' as she said:  "Don't get too high on the bottle, Just a little sip ev'ry now and then. Fight your fights, find a grace, And all the things that you can change, And help somebody if you can. And get right with the Man."  Instrumental Break. (C'mon now.)  "I never let a cowboy make the coffee." Yeah, thats what Granny always said to my Grandad. And he'd say: "Never tell a joke that ain't that funny more than once." And "if you wanna hear God laugh, tell Him your plans."  "Don't get too high on the bottle, Get right with the Man, son. Fight your fights, find a grace, And all the things that you can change, And help somebody if you can. And get right with the Man."  Yeah. (Get too high.) (Help somebody if you can.)

I met God's Will on a Halloween night He was dressed as a bag of leaves It hid the braces on his legs at first  His smile was as bright as the August sun When he looked at me As he struggled down the driveway, it almost Made me hurt  Will don't walk too good Will don't talk too good He won't do the things that the other kids do In our neighborhood  I've been searchin', wonderin', thinkin' Lost and lookin' all my life I've been wounded, jaded, loved and hated I've wrestled wrong and right He was a boy without a father And his mother's miracle I've been readin', writin', prayin', fightin' I guess I would be still Yeah, that was until I knew God's will  Will's mom had to work two jobs We'd watch him when she had to work late And we'd all laugh like I hadn't laughed Since I don't know when  Hey Jude was his favorite song At dinner he'd ask to pray And then he'd pray for everybody in the world but him  I've been searchin', wonderin', thinkin' Lost and lookin' all my life I've been wounded, jaded, loved and hated I've wrestled wrong and right He was a boy without a father And his mother's miracle I've been readin', writin', prayin', fightin' I guess I would be still Yeah, that was until I knew God's will  Before they moved to California His mother said, "they didn't think he'd live" And she said, "each day that I have him, well, it's just another gift" And I never got to tell her, that the boy showed me the truth In crayon red, on notebook paper, he'd written, "me and God love you" I've been searchin', prayin', wounded, jaded I guess I would be still Yeah that was until...

It was just another story printed on the second page Underneath the Tiger's football score It said he was only eighteen, a boy about my age They found him face down on his bedroom floor  There'll be services on Friday at the Lawrence Funeral Home Then out on Mooresville highway, they'll lay him 'neath a stone...  How do you get that lonely, how do you hurt that bad To make you make the call, that havin' no life at all Is better than the life that you had How do you feel so empty, you want to let it all go How do you get that lonely... and nobody knows  Did his girlfriend break up with him, did he buy or steal that gun? Did he lose a fight with drugs or alcohol? Did his Mom and Daddy forget to say I love you son? Did no one see the writing on the wall? I'm not blamin' anybody, we all do the best we can I know hindsight's 20u002F20, but I still don't understand...

Ain't it just like one of us To pick up the phone and call after a couple drinks? And say, "How you been? I been wonderin' If maybe you've been thinkin' 'bout me?"  And somewhere in the conversation An old familiar invitation always arrives And I may hate myself in the morning But I'm gonna love you tonight  Everyone's known someone That they just can't help but want And even though we just can't make it work out Well, the want-to lingers on  So once again we wind up in Each other's arms pretending that it's right And I may hate myself in the morning But I'm gonna love you tonight  I know it's wrong But it ain't easy moving on So why can't two friends Remember the good times once again?  Tomorrow when I wake up I'll be feeling a little guilty, a little sad Thinkin' how it used to be Before everything went bad  And I guess that's what it is in lonely Late night calls like this that we try to find And I may hate myself in the morning But I'm gonna love you tonight I may hate myself in the morning But I'm gonna love you tonight

Car door slams, it's been a long day at work I'm out on the freeway and I'm wonderin' if it's all worth The price that I pay, sometimes it doesn't seem fair I pull into the drive and you're standin' there  And you look at me And give me that come-here-baby smile It's all gonna be alright You take my hand Ya pull me close And you hold me tight  And it's the sweet love that you give to me That makes me believe we can make it through anything When it all comes down And I'm feelin' like I'll never last I just lean on you 'cause baby You're my better half  They say behind every man is a good woman But I think that's a lie 'Cause when it comes to you I'd rather have you by my side You don't know how much I count on you to help me When I've given everything I got and I just feel like givin' in  And you look at me And give me that come-here-baby smile It's all gonna be alright You take my hand You pull me close And you hold me tight  And it's the sweet love that you give to me That makes me believe we can make it through anything 'Cause when it all comes down I'm feelin' like I'll never last I just lean on you 'cause baby You're my better half. Woo Ya I need to know  Well, you take my hand Yeah, you pull me close and I understand It's the sweet love that you give to me That makes me believe that we can make it through anything  Oh baby, it's the sweet love that you give to me That makes me believe we can make it through anything 'Cause when it all comes down And I'm feeling like I'll never last  I just lean on you 'cause baby You're my better half Oh, oh baby, you're my better half Oou oou, hey baby, you're my better half Oou oou ya
I can remember when you fit in the palm of my hand. You felt so good in it; no bigger than a minute. How it amazes me you're changin' with every blink. Faster than a flower blooms, they grow up all too soon.  So let them be little, 'Cause they're only that way for a while. Give 'em hope, give them praise, Give them love every day. Let 'em cry, let 'em giggle, Let 'em sleep in the middle, Oh, but let them be little.  I never felt so much in one little tender touch. I live for those kisses, your prayers an' your wishes. An' now you're teachin' me how only a child can see. Tonight, while we're on our knees, all I ask is:  Please, let them be little, 'Cause they're only that way for a while. Give them hope, give them praise, Give them love every day. Let 'em cry, let 'em giggle, Let 'em sleep in the middle, Oh, but let them be little.  The so innocent, precious soul: You turn around, an' it's time to let them go.  So let them be little, 'Cause they're only that way for a while. Give them hope, give 'em praise, Give them love every day. Let 'em cry, let 'em giggle, Let them sleep in the middle, Oh, but let them be little.  Let them be little.
I woke up early with a poundin' in my head I'd been out the night before with all my friends A little worried, kinda wonderin' what I did I said, " Lord, please forgive me for my sins." My wife wanted to kill me, but she tried to save me first "You're goin' if I have to drag your butt to church."  I love this crazy, tragic, Sometimes almost magic, Awful, beautiful life  I read the hymns and kinda sorta sang along And made it through the Sunday sermon wide awake We met the family for dinner at our home Drank some beer, watched a game, and cooked some steaks My little brother had a big fight with his wife And my poor mother sat between'em both all night  I love this crazy, tragic, Sometimes almost magic, Awful, beautiful life  We said a prayer for Cousin Michael in Iraq We're all aware that he may never make it back We talked about the way we missed his stupid jokes And how he loved to be a soldier more than most  I laid in bed that night and thought about the day And how my life is like a roller coaster ride The ups and downs and crazy turns along the way It'll throw you off if you don't hold on tight You can't really smile until you've shed some tears I could die today or I might live on for years  I love this crazy, tragic, Sometimes almost magic, Awful, beautiful life  I love this crazy, tragic, Sometimes almost magic, Awful, beautiful life  Alright It's a beautiful life Awful, beautiful, life I love this life It's a beautiful life

Like a cloud full of rain shouldn't hang in the sky Ice shouldn't burn or a bumblebee fly If you feel so happy, then why do you cry? Oh nothin' 'bout love makes sense  Like an ocean liner shouldn't float on the sea A pearl in an oyster or a circus of fleas Someone so perfect can't be fallin' for me Oh nothin' 'bout love makes sense  Nothin' 'bout love is less than confusing You can win when you're losing Stand when you're fallin' I can't figure it out Nothin' 'bout love can make an equation Nothin' short of amazin' Wish I could explain it But I don't know how  The way that we dance, the reason we dream, That big Italian tower, well how does it lean? Somethin' so strong shouldn't make me this weak Oh nothin' 'bout love makes sense ... Nothin' 'bout love is less than confusing You can win when you're losing Stand when you're fallin' I can't figure it out Nothin' 'bout love can make an equation Nothin' short of amazin' Wish I could explain it But I don't know how  Like the lights of Las Vegas glowin' out of the sand A jumbo shrimp or a baby grand How you touched my heart while you're holdin' my hand Oh nothin' 'bout love makes sense  Oh nothin' 'bout love makes sense Oh nothin' 'bout love makes sense Ooooooo no no no Oh, it don't make sense

Driving down the interstate Running 30 minutes late Singing 'Margaritaville' and minding my own Some foreign car driving dude With a road rage attitude Pulled up beside me talking on his cell phone.  He started yelling at me Like I did something wrong He flipped me the bird And then he was gone.  Some beach somewhere There's a big umbrella Casting shade over an empty chair Palm trees are growing, warm breeze is blowing I picture myself right there On some beach, somewhere.  I circled the parking lot Trying to find a spot Just big enough I could park my ol' truck A man with a big cigar Was getting into his car I stopped and I waited for him to back up But from out of nowhere a Mercedez Benz Came cruising up, and whipped right in.  Some beach, somewhere There's nowhere to go When you've got all day to get there There's cold Margaritas And hot senoritas Smiling with long dark hair On somebeach, somewhere.  Well, I sat in that waiting room Seemed like all afternoon The nurse finally said the doc's ready for you You're not gonna feel a thing We'll give you some novacaine That tooth will be fine in a minute or two But he stuck that needle down deep in my gum And he started drilling before I was numb.  Some beach, somewhere There a beautiful sunset burning up the atmosphere There's music and dancing, lovers romancing In the salty evening air On some beach, somewhere.  On somebeach, somewhere...

Don't you remember The fizz in a pepper Peanuts in a bottle At ten, two and four A fried bologna sandwich With mayo and tomato Sittin' round the table Don't happen much anymore  We've gotten too complicated It's all way over-rated I like the old and out-dated Way of life  Back when a hoe was a hoe Coke was a Coke And crack's what you were doing When you were cracking jokes Back when a screw was a screw The wind was all that blew And when you said, "I'm down with that" Well, it meant you had the flu I miss back when I miss back when I miss back when  I love my records Black and shiny vinyl Clicks and pops and white noise Man, they sounded fine I had my favorite stations The ones that played them all Country, Soul and Rock and Roll What happened to those times? I'm readin' street slang for dummies  'Cause they put pop in my Country I want more for my money The way it was back then Back when a hoe was a hoe  Coke was a Coke And crack's what you were doing When you were cracking jokes Back when a screw was a screw The wind was all that blew And when you said, "I'm down with that" Well, it meant you had the flu I miss back when I miss back when I miss back when Give me a flat top for strumming  I want the whole world a-humming Whoa, just keep it coming The way it was back then Back when a hoe was a hoe  Coke was a Coke And crack's what you were doing When you were cracking jokes Back when a screw was a screw The wind was all that blew And when you said, "I'm down with that" Well it meant you had the flu I miss back when I miss back when I miss back when I miss back when I miss back when
I've never done anything That would ever bring a tear to your eye I've never crossed the line Or needed an alibi to cover up a lie  But darlin' I'll admit They're been times when I could have The thing that kept me strong Is the one thing that is always on my mind  When I think about cheatin' I just think about you leavin' And how my world would fall to pieces If I tossed your love away Even when I'm tempted by some stranger Oh, there's never any danger I just think about you leavin' When I think about cheatin'  There was a time in Abilene When he said all the things I wanted to hear It was hard to turn him down Between the champagne and the sound of whispers in my ear  But it just took one Two-step with someone and I was missing you He never had a chance 'cause I broke up the dance Before the song was through  When I think about cheatin' I just think about you leavin' And how my world would fall to pieces If I tossed your love away Even when I'm tempted by some stranger Oh, there's never any danger I just think about you leavin' When I think about cheatin'  And when I'm tempted by some stranger Oh, there's never any danger I just think about you leavin' When I think about cheatin'

Before I fall in bed tonight,  If the dog didn't eat the classifieds I'm gonna look just one more time.  Well, Pampers melt in a Maytag dryer, Crayons go up one drawer higher, Rewind Barney for the fiftheenth time, Breakfast 6, naps at 9, There bubblegum in the baby's hair, Sweet potatoes in my lazy chair,  Been crazy all day long, and it's only Monday- Mr. Mom!

He said I hate this bar and I hate to drink, But on second thought, tonight I think I hate everything.  Then he opened up his billfold and threw a 20 down And a faded photograph fell out and hit the ground And I picked it up he said Thank ya bud. I put it in his hand, He said I probably oughta throw This one away, 'cause she's the reason I feel this way, I hate everything.  Well, I hate my job, and I hate my life. And if it werent for my two kids, I'd hate my ex-wife. I know I should move on and try to start again, But I just can't get over her leaving me for him. Then he shook his head and looked down at his ring, And said I hate everything.  He said, That one bedroom apartment where I get my mail, Is really not a home, it's more like a jail, With a swimming pool and a parking lot view. Man, it's just great!  I hate summer, winter, fall, and spring, Red and yellow, purple, blue and green. I hate everything.  I hate my job, and I hate my life. And if it werent for my two kids, I'd hate my ex-wife. I know I should move on and try to start again, But I just can't get over her leaving me for him. Then he shook his head and looked down at his ring, And said I hate everything. So I pulled out my phone and I called my house I said Babe, I'm coming home we're gonna work this out. I paid for his drinks and I told him Thanks! Thanks for everything...

I watched him take the two strike call He hadn't tried to swing at all I guess he had all he could take He walked away for goodness sake His father's voice was loud and mean "You won't amount to anything".  That little boy quit trying He just walked away There were tear drops on his face Tell me how would you feel You'd probably give up too If nobody believed in you.  That old man said, "One more try I know I'm not too old to drive I promise son, I'll do my best This time I'm gonna pass the test" "Give me the keys dad and get in" His father never drove again.  That old man quit trying He just turned away There were tear drops on his face Tell me how would you feel You'd probably give up too If nobody believed in you.  We take his name out of schools The lawyers say it breaks the rules Pledge of allegiance can not be read And under God should not be said I wonder how much he will take I just pray it's not too late.

She put him out, like the burning end of a midnight cigarette She broke his heart He spend his whole life trying to forget We watch him drink his pain away Little at a time But he never could get drunk enough To get her of his mind until the night He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger And finally drank away her memory Life is short but this time it was bigger And the strength he had to get up off his knees We found him with his face down in the pillow With a note that said I'll love her till I die And when we buried him beneath the willow The Angels sang a whiskey lullaby la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la The rumors flew But nobody knew how much she blamed herself For years and years She tried to hide the whiskey on her breathe She finally drank her pain away little at a time But she never could get drunk enough to get him of her mind Until the night She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger And finally drank away his memory Life is short but this time it was bigger Than the strength she had to get up off her knees We found her with her face down in the pillow Clinging to his picture for dear life We laid her next to him beneath the willow While the Angels sang a whiskey lullaby la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la

In my daughter's eyes, I am a hero I am strong and wise, and I know no fear But the truth is plain to see She was sent to rescue me I see who I want to be In my daughter's eyes  In my daughter's eyes Everyone is equal Darkness turns to light And the world is at peace This miracle God gave to me Gives me strength when I am weak I find reason to believe  In my daughter's eyes  And when she wraps her hand around my finger Oh it puts a smile in my heart  Everything becomes a little clearer I realize what life is all about It's hangin' on when your heart Has had enough It's givin' more when you feel like givin' up  I've seen the light It's in my daughter's eyes  In my daughter's eyes I can see the future A reflection of who I am and what will be Though she'll grow and someday leave Maybe raise a family When I'm gone I hope you see How happy she made me For I'll be there In my daughter's Eyes
He can't remember The times that he thought Does my daddy love me? Probably not That didn't stop him From wishing that he did Didn't keep him from wanting Or worshiping him He guesses he saw him About once a year He could still feel the way he felt Standing in tears Stretching his arms out As far as they'd go Whispering daddy  I want you to know I love you this much And I'm waiting on you To make up your mind Do you love me too? How ever long it takes I'm never giving up no matter what I love you this much He grew to hate him for what he had done  'Cause what kind of father Could do that to his son? He said 'damn you daddy' The day that he died The man didn't blink But the little boy cried  I love you this much  And I'm waiting on you  To make up your mind Do you love me too? How ever long it takes I'm never giving up no matter what I love you this much Half way through the service While the choir sang a hymn He looked up above the preacher And he sat and stared at him He said  'Forgive me father' When he realized That he hadn't been unloved  Or alone all his life His arms were stretched out As far as they'd go Nailed to the cross For the whole world to know I love you this much And I'm waiting on you To make up your mind Do you love me too? How ever long it takes I'm never giving up no matter what I love you this much (end)
Remember when I was young and so were you And time stood still and love was all we knew You were the first so was I We made love and then you cried. Remember when  Remember when we vowed the vows and walked the walk Gave our hearts, made the start, it was hard We lived and learned, life threw curves There was joy, there was hurt. Remember when  Remember when old ones died and new were born And life was changed, disassembled, rearranged We came together, fell apart And broke each other's hearts. Remember when  Remember when the sound of little feet Was the music we danced to week to week Brought back the love, we found trust Vowed we'd never give it up. Remember when  Remember when thirty seemed so old Now lookin' back, it's just a steppin' stone To where we are, where we've been Said we'd do it all again. Remember when  Remember when we said when we turned gray When the children grow up and move away We won't be sad, we'll be glad For all the life we've had And we'll remember when Remember when. Remember when

The moment was custom made to order I was ridin' with my daughter on our way back from Monroe An' like children do she started playin' twenty questions' But I never would've guessed one could touch me to my soul  She said, "Daddy, when we get to Heaven, can I taste the Milky Way? Are we goin' there to visit or are we goin' there to stay? Am I gonna see my Grandpa? Can I have a pair of wings? An' do you think that God could use another Angel To help pour out the rain?"  Well, I won't lie, I pulled that car right over An' I sat there on the shoulder tryin' to dry my misty eyes An' I whispered, "Lord, I wanna thank you for my children 'Cause your innocence that fills them often takes me by surprise"  Like, "Daddy, when we get to Heaven, can I taste the Milky Way? Are we goin' there to visit, or are we goin' there to stay? Am I gonna see my Grandpa? Can I have a pair of wings? An' do you think that God could use another Angel To help pour out the rain?"  Well, I thought about it later on An' a smile came to my face An' when I tucked her into bed I got down on my knees an' prayed  "Lord, when I get to Heaven, can I taste the Milky Way? I don't wanna come to visit 'cause I'm comin' home to stay An' I can't wait to see my family and meet Jesus face to face An' do you think, Lord, you could use another Angel To help pour out the rain?"  Mmm, can I help pour out the rain? Can I help pour out the rain?

In the early rush of morning Trying to get the kids to school One's hanging on my shirttail Another's locked up in her room And I'm yelling up the stairs Stop worrying about your hair You look fine  Then they're fighting in the backseat And I'm playing referee Now someone's gotta go The moment that we leave And everybody's late I swear that I can't wait Till they grow up  Then they do And that's how it is It's just quiet in the morning Can't believe how much you miss All they do And all they did You want all the dreams they dreamed of to come true Then they do  Now the youngest is starting college She'll be leaving in the fall And Brianna's latest boyfriend Called to ask if we could talk And I got the impression That he's about to pop the question Any day  I look over at their pictures Sitting in their frames I see them as babies I guess that'll never change You pray all their lives That some day they will find happiness  Then they do And that's how it is It's just quiet in the morning Can't believe how much you miss All they do And all they did You want all the dreams they dreamed of to come true Then they do  No more Monday PTAs No carpools or soccer games Your work is done Now you've got time that's all your own You've been waiting for so long For those days to come  Then they do And that's how it is It's just quiet in the morning Can't believe how much you miss All they do And all they did You want all the dreams they dreamed of to come true Then they do Oh, then they do

He had plastic bags wrapped 'round his shoes He was covered with the evening news Had a pair of old wool socks on his hands  The bank sign was flashing 5 below It was freezing rain and spittin' snow He was curled up behind some garbage cans I was afraid that he was dead I gave him a gentle shake When he opened up his eyes I said, "Old man are you ok?"  He said,"I just climbed out of a cottonwood tree I was runnin' from some honey bees Drip dryin' in the summer breeze After jumpin' into Calico creek I was walkin' down an old dirt road Past a field of hay that had just been mowed Man I wish you'd just left me alone 'Cause I was almost home"  He said "I was just comin' round the barn 'Bout the time you grabbed my arm When I heard Momma holler, "Son hurry up" I was close enough for my own nose To smell fresh cobbler on the stove And I saw daddy loadin' up the truck Cane poles on the tailgate Bobbers blowin' in the wind Since July of '55 That's as close as I've been"  He said,"I just climbed out of a cottonwood tree I was runnin' from some honey bees Drip dryin' in the summer breeze After jumpin' into Calico creek I was walkin' down an old dirt road Past a field of hay that had just been mowed Man I wish you'd just left me alone 'Cause I was almost home"  I said,"Old man you're gonna freeze to death Let me drive you to the mission" He said,"Boy if you'd left me alone Right now I'd be fishin'"  He said,"I just climbed out of a cottonwood tree I was runnin' from some honey bees Drip dryin' in the summer breeze After jumpin' into Calico creek I was walkin' down an old dirt road Past a field of hay that had just been mowed Man I wish you'd just left me alone 'Cause I was almost home" Man I wish you'd just left me alone Cause I was almost home (almost home) Man I wish you'd just left me alone I was almost home

A farmer and a teacher, a hooker and a preacher Ridin' on a midnight bus bound for Mexico. One was headed for vacation, one for higher education And two of them were searchin' for lost souls. That driver never ever saw the stop sign. An' eighteen wheelers can't stop on a dime.  There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway Why there's not four of them, Heaven only knows. I guess it's not what you take when you leave this world behind you It's what you leave behind you when you go.  That farmer left a harvest, a home and eighty acres The faith an' love for growin' things in his young son's heart. And that teacher left her wisdom in the minds of lots of children: Did her best to give 'em all a better start. An' that preacher whispered: "Can't you see the Promised Land?" As he laid his blood-stained bible in that hooker's hand.  There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway Why there's not four of them, Heaven only knows. I guess it's not what you take when you leave this world behind you It's what you leave behind you when you go.  That's the story that our preacher told last Sunday. As he held that blood-stained bible up For all of us to see. He said: "Bless the farmer, and the teacher, an' that preacher "Who gave this Bible to my mamma "Who read it to me."  There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway Why there's not four of them, now I guess we know. It's not what you take when you leave this world behind you It's what you leave behind you when you go.  There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway.

THE TRUTH ABOUT MEN  TRACY BYRD, BLAKE SHELTON, ANDY GRIGGS, & MONTGOMERY GENTRY  We don't like to go out shoppin' We don't care what's on sale. We just want to sit with a bag full of chips Watchin' the NFL. When you come over at half-time An' say: "Does this dress fit too tight?" We just look you in the eye with a big fat lie An say: "Uh, uh: Looks just right."  Well, that's the truth about men. Yeah, that's the truth about us. We like to hunt and golf on our days off Scratch, an' spit, an cuss. It don't matter what line we hand you When we come draggin' in. We ain't wrong; we ain't sorry An' it's probably gonna happen again.  We hate watchin' "Steel Magnolias". We like "Rambo" an' "Die Hard 4".  Troy (Montgomery Gentry): Jump up and down like fools when we see the new tools  Eddie (Montgomery Gentry): At the Home Depot store.  We don't really wanna take you to dinner At some fancy restaurant.  The only reason we do is 'cause we know it leads to The one thing that we all want.  Well, that's the truth about men. Yeah, that's the truth about guys. We'd rather pick guitars and work on cars  Than work on the problems in our lives. An' though we might say it to you Every now and then  We ain't wrong; we ain't sorry An' it's probably gonna happen again.  Well, if you want to know what we're all thinkin' It's nothing too complex. It's just somethin' cold for drinkin' And a whole lot of s-e ...  Yes, that's the truth about men. Yeah, that's the truth about us.

I hear people saying, we don't need this war. But I say, there's some things worth fighting for.  What about our freedom? And this piece of ground? We didn't get to keep 'em by backin' down. They say we don't realize the mess we're getting in. Before you start to preachin' let me ask you this, my friend. Have you forgotten how it felt that day?  To see our home land under fire, and her people blown away. Have you forgotten when those towers fell? We had neighbors still inside, goin' through a livin' hell. And you say we shouldn't worry 'bout Bin Laden... have you forgotten? They took all the footage off my T.V. Said it's too disturbing, for you and me. It'll just breed anger, that's what the experts say.  If it was up to me, I'd show it every day. Some say this country's just out, lookin' for a fight. Well, after 9u002F11, man, I'd have to say that's right. Have you forgotten how it felt that day? To see our home land under fire, and her people blown away. Have you forgotten when those towers fell?  We had neighbors still inside, goin' through a livin' hell. And we vowed to get the ones behind Bin Laden. Have you forgotten?  I've been there with the soldiers who've gone away to war, and you can bet that they remember just what they're fighting for. Have you forgotten all the people killed? Yeah, some went down like heroes in that Pennsylvania field. Have you forgotten about our pentagon? All the loved ones that we lost, and those left to carry on. Don't you tell me not to worry about Bin Laden. Have you forgotten? Have you forgotten? Have you forgotten?
It ticks just like a Timex It never lets up on you Who said life was easy The job is never through It runs us 'til we're ragged It'll harden our hearts And love could use a day of rest Before we both start fallin' apart  I pray that it's rainin' on Sunday Stormin' like crazy We'll hide under the covers all afternoon Baby whatever comes Monday Can take care of itself 'Cause we've got better things that we can do When it's rainin' on Sunday  Your love is like religion A cross in Mexico And your kiss is like the innocence Of a prayer nailed to a door  Oh surrender is much sweeter When we both let it go Let the water wash our bodies clean And love wash our souls  And pray that it's rainin' on Sunday Stormin' like crazy And we'll hide under the covers all afternoon And baby whatever comes Monday  Can take care of itself 'Cause we've got better things that we can do When it's rainin' on Sunday Ooh, oh oh  I pray that it's rainin' on Sunday Stormin' like crazy We'll hide under the covers all afternoon And baby whatever comes Monday Can take care of itself 'Cause we've got better things that we can do  When it's rainin' on Sunday Ooh, oh oh When it's rainin' on Sunday When it's rainin' on Sunday Let it rain Whoa, oou
she walks to school with the lunch she packed nobody knows what she's holding back wearing the same dress she wore yesterday she hides the bruises with the linen and lace ohhh the teacher wonders but she doesn't ask  it's hard to see the pain behind the mask bearing the burden of the secret storm sometimes she wishes she was never born through the wind and the rain she stands hard as a stone in a world that she can't rise above but her dreams give her wings and she flies to a place where she's loved concrete angel  somebody cries in the middle of the night the neighbors hear but they turn out the light a fragile soul caught in the hands of fate when morning comes it'll be too late through the wind and the rain she stands hard as a stone in a world that she can't rise above  but her dreams give her wings and she flies to a place where she's loved concrete angel a statue stands in a shaded place an angel girl with an upturned face a name is written on a polished rock a broken heart that the world forgot  through the wind and the rain she stands hard as a stone in a world that she can't rise above but her dreams give her wings and she flies to a place where she's loved concrete angel
She's my kind of rain Like love in a drunken sky She's confetti fallin' Down all night  She sits quietly there Black water in a jar Says, baby why are you Tremblin' like you are So I wait And I try I confess like a child  She's my kind of rain Like love from a drunken sky Confetti fallin' down all night She's my kind of rain  She's the sun set shadows She's like rembrandt's light She's the history that's made at night She's my lost companion  She's my dreamin' tree Together in this brief eternity Summer days, winter snows She's all things to behold  She's my kind of rain Like love from a drunken sky Confetti fallin' down all night She's my kind of rain  So I wait And I try I confess all my crimes She's my kind of rain Like love from a drunken sky Confetti fallin' down all night She's my kind of rain  She's my kind of rain Like love from a drunken sky Confetti fallin' down all night She's my kind of rain She's my kind of rain Oh, rain on me She's my kind of rain
She was aware of her insecurities as she took the stage She was convinced if she got up there that She'd be discovered someday.  So she belted it She hit the high notes fearlessly Oh she melted them As she brought them to their feet.  Chorus: She was a big star At Banana Joe's bar Where she sang karaoke every night She said if you work hard to get where you are It feels good in the hot spot light She was a big star.  She made the local cable shows Where the camera fell in love with her face After a couple of weekends The groupies were crawling all over the place.  She signed autographs Like she was Garth Brooks in a skirt And in the aftermath That small time town was hers.  Chorus: She was a big star At Banana Joe's bar Where she sang karaoke every night She said if you work hard to get where you are It feels good in the hot spot light She was a big star.  She doesn't care anymore That her high school girlfriends cut her down The only thought she entertains is where they are And where she is now.  Her old neighbors swear they're certain she slept her way to the top She knows you don't get where your going Less you got somethin they ain't got.  So she sings tonight To 20, 000 plus And the young girls scream out loud Man that could be us.  She's a big star As she eats caviar Just before she performs every night She says if you work hard To get where you are It feels good in the hot spot light She's a big star. She's a big star...
If money grew on hackberry trees If time wasn't such a luxury If love was lovesick over me That'd be alright  If I could keep the wind in my sails Keep a hold of the tiger by the tail A half a ham sandwich in my lunch pail That'd be alright  If that'd be alright That'd be alright  If everybody everywhere Had a lighter load to bear And a little bigger piece of the pie We'd be livin' us a pretty good life And that'd be alright  Go heavy on the good and light on the bad A hair more happy and shade less sad Turn all the negative down just a tad That'd be alright  If my dear old dog never got old If the family farm never got sold Another bad joke never got told That'd be alright If that'd be alright If that'd be alright  If everybody everywhere Had a lighter load to bear And a little bigger piece of the pie We'd be livin' us a pretty good life And that'd be alright  If that'd be alright That'd be alright  If everybody everywhere Had a lighter load to bear And a little bigger piece of the pie We'd be livin' us a pretty good life And that'd be alright  If that'd be alright That'd be alright  If everybody everywhere Had a lighter load to bear And a little bigger piece of the pie We'd be livin' us a pretty good life And that'd be alright  If that'd be alright That'd be alright If that'd be alright That'd be alright That'd be alright

I always said that'd be it that I wouldn't stick around if it ever came to this and here I am so confused how am I supposed to leave? when I can't even move  In the time it would have took to say "honey I'm home how was your day?" you dropped a bomb right where we live and just expect me to forgive  Well that's a mighty big word for such a small man, and I'm not sure I can Cause I don't even know now who I am It's too soon for me to say forgive.  I should ask but I won't was it love or just her touch cause I don't think I wanna know so get you some things and get out (get out, get out) don't call me for a day or two so I can sort this out  well you might as well've ripped the life right out of me right here tonight and through the fallin tears you said "can you ever just forgive?"  Well, thats a mighty big word for such a small man and I'm not sure I can Cause I don't even know now who I am it's too soon for me to say forgive.  you know what they say (say, say) forgive and forget relive and regret  forgive oh, that's a mighty big word for such a small man and I'm not sure I can Cause I don't even know now who I am its too soon for me to say forgive.  oh, its too soon for me to say forgive.
I was ten, I was thin, I was playing first base with a secondhand glove and dirt on my face In nowhere, Virginia Who'd ever figure that kid in the yard would go very far Cause 419 Lakewood had no silver spoons Just an old beat up upright that played out of tune Now I'm singin' and living the life that I love And when I count my blessings I thank God I was An American child  An American child 'Cause dreams can grow wild Born inside an American child  Seven pounds, three ounces, she's got my nose And she's into my heart as deep as it goes With a promise that's more than just someone's last name Anyone's equal, in late August came An American child  An American child 'Cause dreams can grow wild Born inside an American child  My grandfather would have been eighty today But in '45 he fell down beside an American child  An American child Oh, an American child 'Cause dreams can grow wild born inside an American child An American child

When I walked in, the band just started, The singer couldn't carry a tune in a bucket. Was on a mission to drown her memory but I thought no way with all this ruckus.  But after One round with Jose Cuervo, I caught my boots tappin' 'long with the beat. And after Two rounds with Jose Cuervo, That band was soundin' pretty darn good to me.  Then some stranger asked me dance And I revealed to her my two left feet. Said, "Don't get me wrong I'm glad you asked, But tonight's about me and an old memory."  Then after Three rounds with Jose Cuervo, I let her lead me out on the floor, And after Four rounds with Jose Cuervo, I was showin' off moves never seen before.  Well at round five or round six, I forgot what I came to forget. After round seven -or was it eight?- I bought a round for the whole dang place!  And after Nine rounds with Jose Cuervo, They were countin' me out and I was about to give in, Then after, Ten rounds with Jose Cuervo, I lost count and started countin' again!  One round with Jose Cuervo... I went Two rounds with Jose Cuervo... Three rounds with Jose Cuervo... Five (Four)- or was it four? Hahahahahaha... Six rounds with Jose Cuervo... Eight rounds with Jose Cuervo... Ten rounds with Jose Cuervo...
If I lived and breathed before you loved me, I don't recall If I walked around at all, it was in bits and pieces of a jagged heart You kissed me and every piece went back in place, every pain got erased You held me up to the sun light, now it feels like  No one ever left me out in the rain Cold words still remain unspoken And I never got lost, spent years in the dark You're here, now my heart's unbroken When I see your smile, fill my soul again and I'm unbroken  If I doubted the power of love baby, now I understand I thank God for every day I wake up To the soft touch of your magic hands In this world sometimes the only thing that's real is the way you make me feel Babe, the changes day and night, I swear it's like  No one ever left me out in the rain Cold words still remain unspoken And I never got lost, spent years in the dark You're here, now my heart's unbroken When I see your smile, fill my soul again and I'm unbroken  I still see the night, I fell into your eyes And when we made love it felt like the first time  No one ever left me out in the rain Cold words still remain unspoken And I never got lost, spent years in the dark You're here, now my heart's unbroken When I see your smile, fill my soul again and I'm unbroken  Hey, I'm unbroken Oh hey, I'm unbroken  No one ever left me out in the rain Cold words still remain unspoken And I never got lost, spent years in the dark You're here, now my heart's unbroken  No one ever left me out in the rain Cold words still remain unspoken I never got lost, spent years in the dark You're here, now my heart's unbroken  No one ever left me out in the rain Cold words still remain unspoken

Maybe, tonight, we could close the door and lock ourselves inside Take time to feel I don't want to miss the chance to be so real The days all fly away And I forget the truth Everything that matters is in this room  When you lie next to me Breathin' the air I breathe We don't have to speak And just be Our love's a precious thing Don't want to waste a day Or one more minute Without you in it Life if so sweet When you lie next to me  My heart is yours But every part of me still wants to give you more More time to love Cause you never know when life will leave us I want to take in all the beauty here Let the world around us just disappear  When you lie next to me Breathin' the air I breathe We don't have to speak And just be Our love's a precious thing Don't want to waste a day Or one more minute Without you in it Life if so sweet When you lie next to me  When you lie next to me Breathin' the air I breathe We don't have to speak And just be Our love's a precious thing Don't want to waste a day Or one more minute Without you in it Life if so sweet When you lie next to me
My dad chased monsters from the dark He checked underneath my bed. He could lift me with one arm Way up over top his head. He could loosen rusty bolts With a quick turn of his wrench He pulled splinters from his hand And never even flinched. In thirteen years I'd never seen him cry But the day that grandpa died, I realized: Unsinkable ships sink.  Unbreakable walls break. Sometimes the things you think could never happen Happen just like that. Unbendable steel bends. If the fury of the wind is unstoppable I've learned to never underestimate The impossible. Then there was my junior year Billy had a brand new car.  It was late, the road was wet I guess the curve was just too sharp. I walked away without a scratch. They brought the helicopter in. Billy couldn't feel his legs. Said he'd never walk again. But Billy said he would and his Mom and Daddy prayed And the day we graduated, he stood up to say: "Unsinkable ships sink. "Unbreakable walls break. "Sometimes the things you think could never happen  "Happen just like that. "Unbendable steel bends. "If the fury of the wind is unstoppable "I've learned to never underestimate "The impossible." So don't tell me that it's over. Don't give up on you and me. 'Cause there's no such thing as hopeless If you believe: Unsinkable ships sink.  Unbreakable walls break. Sometimes the things you think could never happen Happen just like that. Unbendable steel bends. If the fury of the wind is unstoppable I've learned to never underestimate The impossible.
Well, me an' my lady had our first big fight, So I drove around 'til I saw the neon light. A corner bar, an it just seemed right. So I pulled up.  Not a soul around but the old bar keep, Down at the end an' looking half asleep. An he walked up, an' said: "What'll it be?" I said: "The good stuff."  He didn't reach around for the whiskey; He didn't pour me a beer. His blue eyes kinda went misty, He said: "You can't find that here."  'Cos it's the first long kiss on a second date. Momma's all worried when you get home late. And droppin' the ring in the spaghetti plate, 'Cos your hands are shakin' so much. An' it's the way that she looks with her eyes and her hair. Eatin' burnt suppers the whole first year An' askin' for seconds to keep her from tearin' up. Yeah, man, that's the good stuff.  He grabbed a carton of milk an' he poured a glass. An' I smiled an' said: "I'll have some of that." We sat there an' talked as an hour passed, Like old friends.  I saw a black an' white picture an' it caught my stare, It was a pretty girl with bouffant hair. He said: "That's my Bonnie, Taken 'bout a year after we were wed."  He said "Spent five years in the bar, When the cancer took her from me. But I've been sober three years now, 'Cos the one thing stronger than the whiskey:  Was the sight of her holdin' my baby girl. The way she adored that string of pearls, I gave her the day that our youngest boy, Earl, Married his high school love. An' it's a new tee-shirt saying: 'I'm a Grandpa'. Bein' right there as our time got small, An' holdin' her hand, when the Good Lord called her up, Yeah, man, that's the good stuff.  He said: "When you get home, she'll start to cry." When she says: 'I'm sorry,' say: 'So am I.' An' look into those eyes, so deep in love, An' drink it up. 'Cos that's the good stuff. That's the good stuff.

She started her new life ten dollars in debt That's all it took to get started back then A trip to the courthouse across the state line No one could stop her, she'd made up her mind He was eighteen, she wasn't  But she said she was and never thought twice Came back home as my daddy's wife She just shook her head when her momma said "Are you sure he's the one?" She was  He took a job and farmed on the side He made the ends meet, but she kept 'em tied Changes were coming to their little world She said "What would you like, a boy or a girl?" He said "Are you?"  She said she was and never thought twice 'Bout takin the next step in building their lives Soon there were three and she tried to be Everything to us And she was  Those precious moments turned into years In what seemed like the blink of an eye I held her hand as I leaned down to ask her "Momma, Are you ready to say goodbye?"  She said she was but she thought twice Holdin' my hand as she let go of life Daddy always said a woman like her Would be hard to give up And she was  She was  If there ever was a picture of love, She was
No rush though I need your touch I won't rush your heart Until you feel on solid ground Until your strength is found, girl  I'll fill those canyons in your soul Like a river lead you home And I'll walk a step behind In the shadows so you shine Just ask it will be done And I will prove my love Until you're sure that I'm "the one"  Somebody else was here before He treated you unkind And broken wings need time to heal Before a heart can fly, girl  I'll fill those canyons in your soul Like a river lead you home And I'll walk a step behind In the shadows so you shine Just ask it will be done And I will prove my love Until you're sure that I'm "the one"  Trust in me and you'll find a heart so true All I want to do is give the best of me to you And stand beside you  Just ask it will be done And I will prove my love Until you're sure that I'm "the one"

It was painted red, the stripe was white It was feet, from the bow to stern light Secondhand, from a dealer in Atlanta I rode up with daddy, when he went there to get her  We put on a shine, put on a motor Built out of love, and made for the water Ran her for years, 'til the transom got rotten A piece of my childhood, will never be forgoten  It was, just an old plywood boat With a Johnson With electric choke A young boy two hands on the wheel I can't replace the way it made me feel And I would turn her sharp And I would make it whine He'd say, "You can't beat the way a old wood boat rides"  Just a little lake cross the Alabama line But I was king of the ocean When daddy let me Drive  Just an old half ton short bed Ford My uncle bought new, in ' Daddy got it right, 'cause the engine was smoking A couple of burnt valves, and he had it going  He'd let me drive her when we haul off a load Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thigpen Road I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedels Smiling like a hero that just received his medal  It was just an old hand-me-down Ford With speed on the column and a dent in the door A young boy, two hands on the wheel I can't replace the way it made me feel and And I would press that clutch And I would, keep it right He'd say, "a little slower son; you're doing just fine"  Just a dirt road with trash on each side But I was Mario Andretti When daddy let me Drive  I'm grown up now Three daughters of my own I let them drive my old jeep Across the pasture at our home  Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file And pull out that old memory And think of me and smile And say  It was just an old worn out jeep Rusty old floor boards Hot on my feet A young girl, two hands on the wheel I can't replace the way it, made me feel And he'd say turn it left And steer it right Straighten up girl now, you're doing just fine  Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride But I was high on a mountain When daddy let me Drive  Daddy let me drive  Oh he let me, drive  It's just an old plywood boat With a Johnson And electric choke

There's a man standing on the corner  With a sign sayin "will work for food" You know the man You see him every morning The one you never give your money to You can sit there with your window rolled up Wondering when the lights going to turn green Never knowing what a couple more bucks In his pocket might mean What if he's an angel sent here from Heaven  And he's making certain that you're doing your best To take the time to help one another Brother are you going to pass that test You can go on with your day to day Trying to forget what you saw in his face Knowing deep down it could have been his saving grace What if he's an angel There's a man  And There's a woman Living right above you in apartment G There's alot of noise coming through the ceiling And it don't sound like harmony You can sit there with your TV turned up While the words and his anger fly But Come tomorrow when you see her with her shades on  Can you look her in the eye What if she's an angel sent here from heaven  And she's making certain that you're doing your best To take the time to help one another Brother are you going to pass that test You can go on with your day to day Trying to forget what you saw in her face Knowing deep down it could have been her saving grace What if she's an angel A little girl on daddy's lap  Hiding her disease with a baseball cap You can turn the channel Most people do But what if you were sitting in her daddy's shoes Maybe she's an angel  Sent here from Heaven And she's making certain you're doing your best To take the time to help one another Brother are you going to pass that test You can go on with your day to day Trying to forget what you saw in her face Knowing deep down it could have been her saving grace What if she's an angel

Lookin back now well it makes me laugh, we were growin our hair, we were cuttin class, knew it all already there was nothing to learn, we were strikin matches just to watch em burn.  Listen to our music just a little too loud, we were hanging in there with the outcast crowd, headin to the rapids with some discount beer, it was a long train tressel but we had no fear, Man i don't know where the time goes but it sure goes fast, just like that, we were wannabe rebels that didn't have a clue in our rock n roll teeshirts and our typically bad attitudes had no excuses for the things that we'd done we were brave, we were crazy, we were mostly young, young Talked a good game, when we were out with the guys, but in the backseat we were awkward and shy Girls were a mystery that we couldn't explain, and i guess there are some things that are never gonna change Man i don't know where the time goes, but it sure goes fast, just like that. We were wannabe rebels that didn't have a clue in our rock n roll teeshirts and our typically bad attitudes had no excuses for the things that we'd done we were brave, we were crazy, we were mostly young, young, young Yeah and wishing we were older young hey i wish it wasn't over Man i don't know where the time goes, but it sure goes fast, just like that we were wannabe rebels that didn't have a clue in our rock n roll teeshirts and our typically bad attitudes had no excuses for the things that we'd done we were brave, we were crazy, we were mostly young, young Hey and wishing we were older and i wish it wasn't over
Lately I've been runnin' into our old friends Somewhere in the small talk Someone always asks where you've been So I tell 'em what you told me And they can't believe we're through They ask me what I'm doing now And in case you're wondering too  Chorus: I breathe in, I breathe out Put one foot in front of the other Take one day at a time Until you find I'm that someone you can't live without But until then, Ill breathe in, and breathe out.  Now I've got every reason To find someone new Cause you swore up and down to me That I've seen the last of you But the way that you loved me Left me hopin' and holdin' on So until this world stops turnin' round And my heart believes that you're gone  Chorus: Ill breathe in and breathe out Put one foot in front of the other Take one day at a time Til you find I'm that someone you can't live without But until then, Ill breathe in, and breathe out  Yes we were meant to be Girl there's no doubt And if it takes the rest of my life For you to figure it out  Chorus: Ill breathe in and breathe out Put one foot in front of the other Take one day at a time Until you find I'm that someone you can't live without But until then, Oh, Ill breathe in, and breathe out
I've dealt with my ghosts and I've faced all my demons Finally content with a past I regret I've found you find strength in your moments of weakness For once I'm at peace with myself  I've been burdened with blame, trapped in the past for too long I'm movin' on  I've lived in this place and I know all the faces Each one is different but they're always the same They mean me no harm but it's time that I face it They'll never allow me to change But I never dreamed home would end up where I don't belong I'm movin' on  I'm movin' on At last I can see life has been patiently waiting for me And I know there's no guarantees, but I'm not alone There comes a time in everyone's life When all you can see are the years passing by And I have made up my mind that those days are gone...  I sold what I could and packed what I couldn't Stopped to fill up on my way out of town I've loved like I should but lived like I shouldn't I had to lose everything to find out Maybe forgiveness will find me somewhere down this road I'm movin' on I'm movin' on I'm movin' on
Well, it's a long way to Richmond Rolling north on 95 With a redhead riding shotgun And a pistol by my side Tearing down that highway Like a modern day Bonnie and Clyde  We met at a truck stop Johnson City, Tennesee I was gassin' up my Firebird When I heard her callin' me Said "Which way are you headed boy? Do you need some company?"  She had me stoppin' at a quick mart Before we made it out of town Next thing she was running at me Telling me to lay that hammer down "'Cause there's a man right behind me doing his best to slow me down"  Yeah, and it's a long way to Richmond Rolling north on 95 With a redhead riding shotgun And a pistol by my side Tearing down that highway Like a modern day Bonnie and Clyde  (Break)  Well we pulled up to a motel In the middle of the night We were countin' all the money Smoking stolen Marlboro lights Lord we never saw 'em comin' 'Til they read us both our rights  Yeah, and it's a long way to Richmond Rollin' north on 95 With a sheriff right beside me Pistol pointed at my side Such a disappointing ending For this modern day Bonnie and Clyde

Thumb stuck high in the air Destination anywhere This road decides to go Underneath the desert sky I find a place to hide and rest my weary bones This underpass will shade the heat As my mind drifts off to sleep...  There you are with your hair all down And your feet are bare and your cotton gown What a beautiful sight In the moonlight The way you're looking at me with your loving eyes You let me know that for all my life You would always be my only girl But that's another place in time Back when you were mine In another world  A car stops way up ahead I climb inside her hair is red I thank her for the ride She talks the miles away I nod and smile and try to say Anything to be polite But as the darkness ends the day Another voice whisper's my name  There you are with your hair all down And your feet are bare and your cotton gown What a beautiful sight In the moonlight The way you're looking at me with your loving eyes You let me know that for all my life You would always be my only girl But that's another place in time Back when you were mine In another world  There you are with your hair all down And your feet are bare and your cotton gown What a beautiful sight (beautiful sight) In the moonlight The way you're looking at me with your loving eyes You let me know that for all my life You would always be my only girl But that's another place in time Back when you were mine In another world  In another world In another world

I was just out of the service Thumbin' through the classifieds When an ad that said "Old Chevy" Somehow caught my eye The lady didn't know the year Or even if it ran But I had that thousand dollars in my hand It was way back in the corner of this old ramshackle barn With thirty years of dust and dirt on that green army tarp And when I pulled the cover off It took away my breath What she called a Chevy Was a sixty-six Corvette And I felt a little guilty as I counted out the bills But what a thrill I got When I sat behind the wheel I opened up the glovebox And that's when I found the note The date was 1966 and this is what he wrote  He said "My name is Private Andrew Malone And if you're readin' this, then I didn't make it home But for every dream that's shattered Another one comes true This car was once a dream of mine Now it belongs to you Though you may take her and make her your own  You'll always be riding with Private Malone"  Well it didn't take me long at all I had her runnin' good I loved to hear those horses thunder underneath her hood I had her shinin' like a diamond and I put the rag top down All the pretty girls would stop and stare as I drove her through town The buttons on the radio didn't seem to work quite right But it picked up that Oldie's Show Especially late at night I'd get the feelin' sometimes if I turned real quick I'd see  A soldier ridin' shotgun In the seat right next to me  It was a young man named Private Andrew Malone Who fought for his country and never made it home But for every dream that's shattered Another one comes true  This car was once a dream of his back when it was new He told me to take her and make her my own And I was proud to be riding with Private Malone  One night it was rainin' hard I took the curve too fast  I still don't remember about that fiery crash But someone said they thought they saw a soldier pull me out They didn't get his name But I know without a doubt  It was a young man named Private Andrew Malone Who fought for his country and never made it home But for every dream that's shattered Another one comes true This car was once a dream of his back when it was new And I know I wouldn't be here if he hadn't tagged along yeah that night I was riding with Private Malone Oh thank God I was riding with Private Malone Private Malone

Sometimes I think what turned her on, Was my old broke down boots. She wanted her a real cowboy, It was a phase she was goin' through. Not one week after she moved in, I caught her paintin' the bedroom blue.  Brought home a bottle of pink chablis, Poured out my best home brew. I was sittin' on the porch in my overalls, As she packed her things to leave.  She changed her mind when she couldn't change me. She changed direction, headed out west. Changed her tune to some hip-hop mess. Her dark brown hair went to blonde, And her pretty blue eyes went to green. She changed everything when she couldn't change me.  She was sittin' beside the ocean, Lookin' out at the waves. Watchin' how they keep on rollin', They always seem the same. She called and said she'd been thinkin' about,  All those quiet country nights. And whatever she thought was so wrong with me, Suddenly seemed all right. I was sittin' on the porch in my overalls, When her truck pulled into view. She said: "I changed my mind when I couldn't change you."  She changed direction, headed back home. She changed her tune, it's all Haggard and Jones. Had her dark brown hair pulled back, And the bluest eyes you ever seen. She changed everything when she couldn't change me.  She said: "I guess when you love someone you just gotta let it be." She changed her mind when she couldn't change me.  She changed direction, she's back in my arms. She thought it through, had a change of heart. She said: "I guess when you love someone you just gotta let it be." She changed her mind when she couldn't change me.  Yeah, yeah... She changed it all when she couldn't change me. She couldn't change me. She couldn't change me.

When your heart is all alone every second Seems so long When it's just you, you can't see through Those ol' clouds that rain so blue  But when somebody loves you There's nothing you can't do When somebody loves you It's easy to get through When somebody loves you The way I love you  When it's late, the sun hangs low By yourself, nowhere to go Sing a song, you dance alone Play solitaire and stare at the phone  But when somebody loves you There's nothing you can't do When somebody loves you It's easy to get through When somebody loves you The way I love you  So let's put aside our foolish pride And let our hearts say hello We both agree we're just no good At bein' on our own  'Cause when somebody loves you There's nothing you can't do When somebody loves you It's easy to get through When somebody loves you The way I love you  The way I love you The way I love you
I pulled into the shopping center And saw a little boy wrapped around the legs of his mother Like ice cream melting they embraced Years of bad decisions runnin' down her face All mornin' I'd been thinkin' my life's so hard And they wore everything they own, livin' in a car I wanted to tell him it would be ok But I got just got in my suburban and I drove away  But I don't know why they say grown men don't cry I don't know why they say grown men don't cry  Keep having this dream about my old man I'm 10 years old, and he's holding my hand We're talkin' on the front porch watchin' the sun go down But it was just a dream he was a slave to his job and he couldn't be around So many things I wanna say to him But I just placed a rose on his grave, and I talk to the wind  But I don't know why they say grown men don't cry I don't know why they say grown men don't cry, don't cry  I'm sittin' here with my kids and my wife And everything that I hold dear in my life We say grace and thank the lord Got so much to be thankful for Then it's up the stairs and off to bed and my little girl says I haven't had my story yet.  And everything weighin' on my mind disappears just like that When she lifts her head off her pillow and says, I love you dad  I don't know why they say grown men don't cry I don't know why they say grown men don't cry And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry I don't know why they say grown men don't cry, don't cry

Sometimes it's lonely Sometimes it's only me And the shadows that fill this room  Sometimes I'm fallin' Desperately callin' Howlin' at the moon  Well I might go get me a new tattoo Or take my old Harley for a three day cruise Might even grow me a fu man chu And it's a great day to be alive I know the sun's still shinin' when I close my eyes There's some hard times in the neighborhood But why can't every day be just this good? It's a great day to be alive I know the sun's still shinin' when I close my eyes There's some hard times in the neighborhood But why can't every day be just this good? Oh, yeah-e-yeah
If I live to be a hundred and never see the seven wonders that'll be alright If I don't make it to the big leagues If I never win a grammy I'm gonna be just fine Cause I know exactly who I am  I am Rosemary's granddaughter The spitting image of my father And when the day is done My momma's still my biggest fan Sometimes I'm clueless and I'm clumsy But I've got friends that love me And they know just where I stand It's all a part of me And that's who I am  So when I make a big mistake When I fall flat on my face I know I'll be alright Should my tender heart be broken I will cry those teardrops knowin' I will be just fine 'Cause nothin' changes who I am  I am Rosemary's granddaughter The spitting image of my father And when the day is done My momma's still my biggest fan Sometimes I'm clueless and I'm clumsy But I've got friends that love me And they know just where I stand It's all a part of me And that's who I am  I'm a saint and I'm a sinner I'm a loser I'm a winner I am steady and unstable I am young but I am able  I am Rosemary's granddaughter The spitting image of my father And when the day is done My momma's still my biggest fan Sometimes I'm clueless and I'm clumsy But I've got friends that love me And they know where I stand It's all a part of me And that's who I am  I am Rosemary's granddaughter The spitting image of my father And when the day is done My momma's still my biggest fan Sometimes I'm clueless and I'm clumsy But I've got friends that love me And they know where I stand It's all a part of me And that's who I am  That's who I am
Rolling too slow I stare down this white line With so far to go Headlights keep coming Loneliness humming along Who poured this rain Who made these clouds I stare through this windshield Thinking out loud Time keeps on crawling Love keeps on calling me home I'd jump all these mountains and take to the skies Sail through the heavens with stars in my eyes  If my heart had wings I would fly to you and lie Beside you as you dream If my heart had wings  We both committed We both agreed You do what you have to to get what you need Feeling you near me with so many miles in between Lord, it ain't easy out here in the dark To keep us together so far apart  If my heart had wings I would fly to you and lie Beside you as you dream If my heart had wings  Stuck on this circle Spinning around Cut loose from this rope That's tying me down  If my heart had wings I would fly to you and lie Beside you as you dream If my If my heart had wings I would fly to you and lie Beside you as you dream If my heart had wings
Last night I had a crazy dream A wish was granted just for me It could be for anything I didn't ask for money Or a mansion in Malibu I simply wished, for one more day with you.  One more day One more time One more sunset, maybe I'd be satisfied But then again I know what it would do Leave me wishin' still, for one more day with you. One more day.  First thing I'd do, is pray for time to crawl I'd unplug the telephone  And keep the tv off I'd hold you every second Say a million I love you's That's what I'd do, with one more day with you. One more day One more time  One more sunset, maybe I'd be satisfied But then again I know what it would do Leave me wishin' still, for one more day with you. One more day One more time One more sunset, maybe I'd be satisfied  But then again I know what it would do Leave me wishin' still, for one more day Leave me wishin' still for one more day Leave me wishin' still for one more day With you. One more day...

We were something, you and me Yeah, we had them rolling in the aisles We got it right once, didn't we We had our shot and missed it by a mile Forget the bitter end Can you remember when  We sang, we laughed They all watched us dance They circled around us And toasted to forever We played to win We never gave in And we threw it all away Like your rose bouquet  Passion flows like a long white gown But it ain't easy to keep your love alive We hoped each other would come around We'll use the lessons for better luck next time But how sweet it was back then Do you remember when  We sang, we laughed They all watched us dance They circled around us And toasted to forever We played to win We never gave in And we threw it all away Like your rose bouquet  We sang, we laughed They all watched us dance They circled around us And toasted to forever We played to win We never gave in And we threw, yeah, we threw it all away Like your rose bouquet

I can hear the neighbors They're arguin' again And there hasn't been peace on our street Since who knows when I don't mean to listen in But the shoutin' is so loud I turn up the radio to drown it out  And silently I say a little prayer But for the grace of God, go I I must have been born a lucky guy Heaven only knows how I've been blessed With the gift of your love And I look around and all I see Is your happiness embracin' me Oh, Lord I'd be lost  But for the grace of God I can see that old man He's walkin' past our door And I've been told that he's rich  But he seems so poor 'Cause no one comes to call on him And his phone, it never rings  He wanders through his empty home Surrounded by his things And silently I say a little prayer, yes I do  But for the grace of God, go I I must have been born a lucky guy Heaven only knows how I've been blessed With the gift of your love  And I look around and all I see Is your happiness embracin' me Oh, Lord I'd be lost But for the grace of God  Ooh oh Oh I look around and all I see Is your happiness embracin' me  Oh, Lord I'd be lost But for the grace of God Oh Lord I'd be lost But for the grace of God, yeah. --- Instrumental to fade ---

He promised her a new and better life Out in Arizona underneath the blue neverending sky Swore that he was gonna get things in order he'd send for her When he left her behind it never crossed her mind There is no Arizona  no painted desert, no Sedona If there was a Grand Canyon She could fill it up with the lies he told her but they don't exist, those dreams he sold her she'll wake up and find There is no Arizona  She got a post card with no return address postmarked Tombstone It said I don't know where I'm going next But when I do, I'll let you know May, June, July she wonders why she's still waiting, she'll keep waiting Cause there is no Arizona  no painted desert, no Sedona If there was a Grand Canyon She could fill it up with the lies he's told her but they don't exist, those dreams he sold her She'll wake up and find There is no Arizona  Each day the sun sets in the west her heart sinks lower in her chest And friends keep asking when she's going Finally she tells them  Don't you know... There is no Arizona No painted desert, no Sedona If there was a Grand Canyon she could fill it up with the lies he's told her But they don't exist, those dreams he sold her She'll wake up and find There is no Arizona He promised her a new and better life.

I'm tired of working every day for a dollar  About to choke on my own blue collar This ain't gonna last Misled by the grand illusion I've come to this conclusion I can't make a move too fast It was written in the sky today By the morning sun it sure looks like a good day to run Wide open down a two-lane highway  It's about time that some things went my way Throwing troubles out to the wind and I'm praying that they never catch up again I'm gonna say my worrying days are done And this looks like a good day to run My baby's been working as a cashier  She didn't get a vacation this past year  Now it won't be long We don't need no destination Just a tank of gas and a good clear station Playing our favorite song There're some places that we ain't been Some things we ain't done And it sure looks like a good day to run Wide open down a two-lane highway  It's about time that some things went my way Throwing troubles out to the wind and I'm praying that they never catch up again I'm gonna say my worrying days are done And this looks like a good day to run I'm gonna say my worrying days are done And this looks like a good day to run A good day to run A good day to run

Her parents never took the young girl to church Never spoke of His name never read her His word Two non-believers walking lost in this world Took their baby with them, what a sad little girl  Her daddy drank all day and mommy did drugs Never wanted to play or give kisses and hugs She'd watch the TV and sit there on the couch While her mom fell asleep and her daddy went out  And the drinking and the fighting Just got worse every night Behind their couch she'd be hiding Oh what a sad little life  And like it always does the bad just got worse With every slap and every curse Until her daddy in a drunk rage one night Used a gun on her mom and then took his life  And some people from the city Took the girl far away To a new mom and a new dad Kisses and hugs everyday  Her first day of Sunday school the teacher walked in And a small little girl stared at a picture of Him She said, ���I know that Man up there on that cross I don't know His name but I know He got off���  'Cause He was there in my old house He held me close to His side As I hid there behind our couch The night that my parents died
I had big plans for our future ... Said I'd give you the whole world somehow ... I tried making good on that promise Thought I'd be so much further by now ...  Never could build you a castle Even though you're the queen of my heart But I've had the best of intentions from the start ... Now some people think I'm a loser Cause I seldom get things right  But you make me feel like a winner  When you wrap me in your arms so tight Please tell me you will remember ... No matter how much I do wrong ...  That I had the best of intentions all along I'd give you a ring and I promised you things  ... I always thought we'd do ... But my best laid plan slipped right through my hands  ... To show my love for you And if you could read my heart  Then you'd know without exception It was all with the best of intentions ... I gave you a ring and I promised you things I always thought we'd do But my best laid plan slipped right through my hands ... To show my love for you ... And if you could read my heart Then you'd know without exception It was all with the best of intentions ... So here I am asking forgiveness ... And praying that you'll understand Don't think I take you for granted Girl I know just how lucky I am ... Though you deserve so much better You won't find devotion more true ... Cause I've had the best of intentions Girl, I've had the best of intentions Yes, I've had the best of intentions loving you ...

He was driving home one evening, in his beat up Pontiac. When an old lady flagged him down; Her Mercedes had a flat. He could see that she was frightened, Standing out there in the snow. 'Till he said "I'm here to help you ma'am, By the way, my name's Joe."  She said, "I'm from St. Louis", And I'm only passing through, I must've seen a hundred cars go by, This is awful nice of you."  When he changed the tire, and closed her trunk, And was about to drive away, She said, "How much do I owe you?"  Here's what he had to say:  : Chorus: You don't owe me a thing, I've been there too. And someone once helped me out, Just the way I'm helping you. If you really wanna pay me back, Here's what you do: Don't let the chain of love end with you.  Well a few miles down the road, The lady saw a small cafe. She went in to grab a bite to eat, And then be on her way. But she couldn't help but notice, How the waitress smiled so sweet And how she must've been eight months along, And dead on her feet.  No, she didn't know her story, And she probably never will, When the waitress went to get her change, From a hundred dollar bill, The lady slipped right out the door, And on a napkin left a note. There were tears in the waitress's eyes, When she read what she wrote:  : Chorus: You don't owe me a thing, I've been there too. And someone once helped me out, Just the way I'm helping you. If you really wanna pay me back, Here's what you do: Don't let the chain of love end with you.  That night when she got home from work, The waitress climbed into bed. She was thinking 'bout the money, And what the lady's note had said. As her husband lay there sleeping, She whispered soft and low: "Everything's gonna be alright; I love you, Joe."

She moved into my old apartment That's how we got this whole thing started  She called and said that I had mail Waiting there for me I told her that I'd come and get it How could I know in just a minute That I'd be standing face to face With my own destiny  Oh and we sat there talkin' just like we were old friends Oh then I asked her, "Can I see you again?"  And she said, "Yes!" And I said, "Wow! And she said, "When?" And I said, "How about right now!" Love can't wait Then I asked if she believed in fate And she said, "Yes!"  But days flew by just like a fast train And nothing else has been on my brain Except the thought of how she makes me The man I want to be She's the one I want for a million reasons Loving her is just like breathin' It's easy and it's obvious That she was made for me  Oh then it happened one night lookin' in her eyes Oh when I popped the question much to my surprise  And she said, "Yes!"

Looking back from were I stand tonight I Wouldn't change a thing about my life. Wrong turnes I had to take back in those crazy years. Could not have been mistakes if they have brought me here.  Cuz all my roads have led me to this night, this love I share with you and though the road was never smooth, life has made me someone who. could be the right someone for you.  I don't regret a single broken heart They tought me what love is, and what it's not Someone must have planned our two paths would cross I couldn't see it then, but i was never lost.  Cuz all my roads have led me to this night, this love I share with you and though the road was never smooth, life has made me someone who. could be the right someone for you.  Detours, deadends, endless explorations, you were my only destination.  Cuz all my roads have led me to this night, this love I share with you and though the road was never smooth, life has made me someone who. could be the right someone for you.
He works hard To give her all He thinks, she wants A three car garage Her own, credit cards He pulls in late To wake her up With a kiss goodnight If he could only read her mind  She'd say...

Now, the days have grown Two years of feeling all alone She can't help But wonder what She's doin' wrong 'Cause, lately She'd try anything To turn his head Would it make a difference if she'd said...

I was lousy at math, a failed historian Carlene was the valedictorian I was quarterback in the back of the class She was the whiz kid in the horned-rim glasses It'd been a long time since I'd been around Since I'd set foot on my old stomping ground I ended up by the old school yard And this redhead pulls up in a blue sports car and says "I'll bet you don't remember, I guess it's been forever" It took a second to put it all together, I said  Oh la la la la la lookin' good Carlene Oh my my my my my time's been good to you, if you know what I mean Girl you glitter like Hollywood Good gosh Carlene, you sure are lookin' good  She said "Hop in, let's go for a spin Tell me what you been doing boy and where you've been" I said "I write songs, you probably didn't know and I finally got a couple out on country radio" She said "What a switch, ain't life funny I've got a PhD, now I'm modeling for money Imagine Little Miss 4.0 Just smiling for the camera on the cover of Vogue" I said "You've come a long way since graduation Let me say without reservation You've surpassed everyone's expectations"  Oh la la la la la lookin' good Carlene Oh my my my my my time's been good to you, if you know what I mean Girl you glitter like Hollywood Good gosh Carlene, you sure are lookin' good  I said "I hope to see you again someday" She said "Another ten years is too long to wait Pick me up at my mama's at eight," I said  Oh la la la la la lookin' good Carlene Oh my my my my my time's been good to you, if you know what I mean Oh la la la la la lookin' good Carlene Oh my my my my my time's been good to you, if you know what I mean
I like blue eyes, hers are green Not like the woman of my dreams And her hair's not quite as long as I had planned. Five foot three isn't tall She's not the girl I'd pictured at all. In those paint by number Fantasies I've had.  So it took me by complete suprise When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes. She's not at all what I was lookin for, she's more  No, it wasn't at first sight But the moment I looked twice. I saw the women I was born to love. Her laughter filled my soul When I hold her I don't wanna let go When it comes to her, I can't get enough  So it took me by complete suprise when my heart got lost in those deep green eyes. She's not at all what I was lookin for, she's more!  More than I dreamed of More than any man deserves... and I couldn't ask for a more than a love like hers So it took me by complete suprise When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes. She's not at all what I was lookin for, she's more

Pop a top again I just got time for one more round Sit em up my friends Then I'll be gone Then you can let some other fool sit down  I'd like for you'd to listen to a joke I heard today From a woman who said she was through and calmly walked away I'd tried to smile and did a while it felt so outta place Did you ever hear of a clown with tears drops streamming down his face.  Pop a top again I think I'll have another round Sit em up my friend Then I'll be gone and you can let some other fool sit down.  ... Home for me is misery and here I am wasting time Cause a row of fools on a row of stools is not what's on my mind But then you see her leaving me it's not what I perfer  So it's either here just drinking beer or at home remembering her. Pop a top again I think I'll have another round Sit em up my friend Then I'll be gone and you can let some other fool sit down Pop a top again.
What do you say  (michael dulaney, neil thrasher)  Stuck at a red light outside an adult bookstore, His son said, daddy, what are all those x's for? As the light turned green he changed the subject fast, He started talkin' 'bout football as they drove right past  What do you say in a moment like this? When you can't find the words, oh, to tell it like it is! Just bite your tongue and let your heart lead the way. Let's get out of here, oh, what do you say?  Seventeen years old she was out with her friends They started drinken' at some party 'til she was three sheets to the wind. Her momma always told her she can call no matter what, She was cryin' on the front steps when her mom showed up.  What do you say in a moment like this? When you can't find the words, oh, to tell it like it is! Just bite your tongue and let your heart lead the way. Let's get out of here, oh, what do you say?  Sometimes you gotta listen to the silence, And give yourself a little time to think...  Her every breath is weaker than the last. And lately when she sleeps - she talks about the past. Her husband knows she's tired of holding on, She looks at him and says, "I wanna go home".  What do you say in a moment like this? When you can't find the words to tell it like it is? Just close your eyes and let your heart lead the way, Ohhh, what do you say?  Oh-ooh Just close your eyes and let your heart lead the wa-aa-ay! Ohhh, what do ya say?  Ooo, what do ya say?
When a single mom goes out on a date with somebody new It always winds up feeling more like a job interview My momma used to wonder if she'd ever meet someone Who wouldn't find out about me and then turn around and run  I met the man I call my dad when I was five years old He took my mom out to a movie and for once I got to go A few months later, I remember lying there in bed I overheard him pop the question and I prayed that she'd say yes  And then, all of a sudden, oh it seemed so strange to me How we went from something's missing to a family Looking back, all I can say about all the things he did for me Is I hope I'm at least half the dad that he didn't have to be  I met the girl that's now my wife about three years ago We had the perfect marriage but we wanted something more Now here I stand surrounded by our family and friends Crowded 'round the nursery window as they bring the baby in  And now, all of a sudden, oh it seems so strange to me How we've gone from something's missing to a family Looking through the glass, I think about the man that's standing next to me And I hope I'm at least half the dad that he didn't have to be  And looking back all I can say about all the things he did for me Is I hope I'm at least half the dad that he didn't have to be Yeah, I hope I'm at least half the dad that he didn't have to be Because he didn't have to be You know he didn't have to be

Smoke Rings In The Dark Well, I won't make you tell me what I've come to understand You're a certain kind of Woman I'm a different kind of Man I've tried to make You Love Me You've tried to find a spark Of the flame that burned but somehow turned To Smoke Rings in the Dark  The loneliness within Me Takes a heavy toll 'Cause it burns as slow as whiskey Through an empty aching soul And the night is like a dagger long and cold and sharp As I sit here on the front steps Blowin' Smoke Rings in the Dark  I know I must be going Cause Love's already gone And all I'm taking with Me are the pieces of My Heart And all I'll leave are Smoke Rings in the Dark  The rain falls where it wants to The wind blows where it will Everything on earth goes somewhere But I swear we're standin' still So I'm not gonna wake you I'll go easy on your heart I'll just touch your face and drift away Like Smoke Rings in the Dark  I know I must be going Cause Love's already gone And all I'm taking with Me are the pieces of My Heart And all I'll leave are Smoke Rings in the Dark
I get up and battle the day Things don't always go my way It might rain but that's okay I get to come home to you Sometimes life may get me down And I get tired of getting kicked around I feel lost in this maddening crowd But I get to come home to you  You are my best friend And you are where my heart is And I know at the day's end I get to come home to you  Hanging out in our old sweatshirts You let me complain about a hard day's work I don't know what I did to deserve To get to come home to you  You are my best friend And you are where my heart is And I know at the day's end I get to come home to you  You are my best friend And you are where my heart is And I know at the day's end I get to come home to you  Yes I get to come home to you Oh I love coming home to you

She dropped the phone and burst into tears The doctor just confirmed her fears Her husband held it in and held her tight. Cancer don't discriminate or care if you're just 38 With three kids who need you in their lives. He said, I know that you're afraid and I am, too But you'll never be alone, I promise you'll. When you're weak, I'll be strong When you let go, I'll hold on When you need to cry, I swear that I'll be there to dry your eyes When you feel lost and scared to death Like you can't take one more step Just take my hand, together we can do it I'm gonna love you through it.  She made it through the surgery fine They said they caught it just in time But they had to take more than they planned.  Now it's forced smiles and baggy shirts To hide what the cancer took from her But she just wants to feel like a woman again She said, "I don't think I can do this anymore" He took her in his arms and said That's what my love is for  When you're weak, I'll be strong When you let go, I'll hold on When you need to cry, I swear that I'll be there to dry your eyes When you feel lost and scared to death Like you can't take one more step Just take my hand, together we can do it I'm gonna love you through it.  ooh baby, Yea And when this road gets too long I'll be the rock you lean on Just take my hand, together we can do it I'm gonna love you through it I'm gonna love you through it I'm gonna love you through it...
