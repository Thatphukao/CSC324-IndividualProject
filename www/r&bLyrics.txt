Lie down in your bed your bed of lies  You could never make eye contact Everything you got was based off of my contacts You a fraud, but I'mma remain icon-stat Balenciaga's on my boots with the python strap You was caught up in the rush, and you was caught up in the thrill of it You was with me way before, I hit a quarter mil' in it Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it I was killin' it, man you got me poppin' pills in it I told Baby hit you, I said this nigga buggin' Cause I was doing it for us, I told em fuck the public Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating Overdosin', no more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn But there was something that I should've asked all along  I'mma ask on the song  Do you ever think of me, when you lie? Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies And I knew better, than to look in your eyes They only pretend, you will be mine And you know how you made me, believe You had me caught in every web, that you weaved  But do you ever think of me, when you lie? Lie down in your bed your bed of lies  I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend When the tears roll down it's like you ain't even notice em If you had a heart, I was hoping you would've showed it some What the fuck you really telling me, what you telling me I could tell you lying, get the fuck out, don't yell at me I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone  They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn But there was something that I should've asked all along I'mma ask on the song  So does she know I've been in that bed before A thousand count, and not a single threaded truth  If I was just another girl Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you There's one thing I need to know So call me, when you're not so busy just thinking of yourself  Do you ever think of me, when you lie? Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies And I knew better, than to look in your eyes They only pretend, you will be mine And you know how you made me, believe You had me caught in every web, that you weaved But do you ever think of me, when you lie? Lie down in your bed your bed of lies

Where is Mrs. Right? I gotta find her, her.  Where is Mrs. Right I gotta see her, Travel all across the world just to meet her Get me on a flight I gotta see her, Travel all across the world just to meet her Travel to LA and maybe to the Bay, Come to Chi-Town, she might be out the states, Book a flight to London, book a flight to France, Can we go to Switzerland, can we hit Japan?  Shawty say ya don't but I bet you do, MB on your ring tone, posters in your room, Sassy little thing, like, like the way you talk, Heard you got the goods go ahead show them off, Take a picture quick, send it to my phone, Dimple in your cheek, white Gucci stunners on, Don't know where you've been hiding from me so long, Prodigy, Roc, RayRay and Princeton we on So baby come on  Where is Mrs. Right I gotta see her, Travel all across the world just to meet her Get me on a flight I gotta see her, Travel all across the world just to meet her Travel to LA and maybe to the Bay, Come to Chi-Town, she might be out the states, Book a flight to London, book a flight to France, Can we go to Switzerland, can we hit Japan?  Light-skinned, dark dark-skinned, Long hair don't care long as ya hearts in it. Looking for my Mrs., enough to drive me insane, Matter of fact aye yo Prodigy sing.  Hopping on a plane, coming straight to y'all, In Tokyo we say Kon'nichiwa, is off the walls, London in the spring, pa- Paris in the fall, We don't discriminate girls no we love 'em all, All my German chicks, let me kiss ya back, Open up your Mac Book, put me on your lap, Space and sending smiley faces on the chat, Met some good girls, yeah they're all over the map, But where she at, where she at?  Where is Mrs. Right? I gotta see her, Travel all across the world just to meet her Get me on a flight I gotta see her, Travel all across the world just to meet her Travel to LA and maybe to the Bay, Come to Chi-Town, she might be out the states, Book a flight to London, book a flight to France, Can we go to Switzerland, can we hit Japan?  Flying so high, so high, destination everywhere, I gotta find a way to get to where You are, you are,  Where's my Mrs. Right now, I need her right now, I got some things I wanna say, so I'm gonna write it down, Wipe me down, wipe me down, if I like you, you wifey now, I predict one day we'll be together, I'm a psychic ow, Been to the south, been to the Bay, Even took few trips out the states, I know you an angel, so maybe I should look out of space, Aye D-I-Double G-Y searching for the right one, Prodigy, Double R, Princeton, Ray Ray, let em know where we coming from  Where is Mrs. Right? I gotta see her, Travel all across the world just to meet her Get me on a flight I gotta see her, Travel all across the world just to meet her Travel to LA and maybe to the Bay, Come to Chi-Town, she might be out the states, Book a flight to London, book a flight to France, Can we go to Switzerland, can we hit Japan?  Where is Mrs. Right?
The time is now on everything  Took my heart away from money Aint interested in fame But I pray that never change Ambition is priceless It's something that's in your veins And I put that on my name  Uh, the only hope I had was selling dope Was on my grind cause times was harder than the cellar floor My momma taught me never steal and never tell on folks I grew up looking up to niggas that was selling coke Oh, I was raised by the stop sign No religion I was getting saved by the glock nine By the minute I was getting paid like a hot line Servin' rollin' fiends was calling, we was dot com Well connected, well respected and well protected Aint get accepted, well rejected and now they regret it Aint get my message, was no signal when I was texting The niggas I was calling was fraud and I learned my lesson Now I move with aggression, use my mind as a weapon Cause chances are never given they tooken like interceptions So throw that pass, I'll be the Corner back Me and Folarin MMG gon bring that Warner back  For my Ambition Easy to dream a dream, though it's harder to live it They gon love me for my Ambition Easy to dream a dream, though it's harder to live it They gon love me for my Ambition Easy to dream a dream, though it's harder to live it Look, they gon love me for my ambition  Beautiful music, painting pictures that be my vision  (It speaks for itself. Define Ambition for me?)  My ambition to win, just to get me some ends Help me pay my little rent, maybe sit in a Benz I saw momma praying as she wait on results It was hot in the kitchen can I wait on the porch My father was missing, War Lord Oliver North Life was diggin' me deeper, I kept on coming up short Breaking so many laws, waking up in the dark Who cut my power off? it's time to move that powder soft Not too many options when you coming from the projects Sittin' in the trap now you moving Cyndi Lauper Girls wanna have fun, and a nigga with some change And I doubt that ever change Ambition is priceless that's something thats in your veins  And I doubt that ever change Ambition is my shit and I put that on my name And I doubt that ever change  Well wishes to my opposition You niggas probably cop a plea before you cop a pistol I got nothing against them, they got fucking potential But every nigga who can read gotta get his issue  Subscribe niggas reside where all the lions and killers be And I aint spend a minute up in the streets But I'm limitless mentally, I'm lyrically ZMT Lebron shit, I was heading 6 after 23 And family is everything and money is less important Long as your mama love you, don't ever love a woman I got a lot of bitches, they got a lot of feelings But I got that green on my eyes And that ain't no Donnie Simpson I retire you niggas: fuck you and your position! They play surface so slippery niggas can't even kick it Y'all rambling, talking shit to these bitches You know you real you don't say it You know you real, we gon feel it Ralph!  Beautiful music, painting pictures that be my vision They gon love me for my ambition Easy to dream a dream, though it's harder to live it Look, they gon love me for my ambition Beautiful music, painting pictures that be my vision They gon love me for my ambition

Have you ever fed a lover with just your hands? Close your eyes and trust it, just trust it Have you ever thrown a fist full of glitter in the air? Have you ever looked fear in the face and said I just don't care?  It's only half past the point of no return The tip of the iceberg, the sun before the burn The thunder before lightning, the breath before the phrase Have you ever felt this way?  Have you ever hated yourself for staring at the phone? Your whole life waiting on the ring to prove you're not alone Have you ever been touched so gently you had to cry? Have you ever invited a stranger to come inside?  It's only half past the point of oblivion The hourglass on the table, the walk before the run The breath before the kiss and the fear before the flames Have you ever felt this way?  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la There you are, sitting in the garden Clutching my coffee, calling me sugar You called me sugar  Have you ever wished for an endless night?

Gotta find my way back, way back to you baby. Tryna find my way back, way back to you baby. Gotta find my way back, way back, to you, to us, to love.

I ve heard there was a secret chord ... That David played, and it pleased the Lord  But you don t really care for music, do you? ... It goes like this  The fourth, the fifth The minor fall, the major lift ... The baffled king composing Hallelujah  ... Hallelujah, Hallelujah ...  Hallelujah, Hallelujah ... Your faith was strong but you needed proof  ... You saw her bathing on the roof Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you ...  She tied you To a kitchen chair ...  She broke your throne, and she cut your hair And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah ...  Hallelujah, Hallelujah ... Hallelujah, Hallelujah ...  Maybe there s a God above And all I ever learned from love ... was how to shoot at someone who out drew you ... Its not a cry you can hear at night ... Its not somebody who s seen the light Its a cold and its a broken hallelujah ... Hallelujah, Hallelujah ... Hallelujah, Hallelujah ...

I dance around this empty house Tear us down, throw you out Screaming down the halls Spinning all around and now we fall  Pictures framing up the past Your taunting smirk behind the glass This museum full of ash Once a tickle, now a rash  This used to be a funhouse But now it's full of evil clowns It's time to start the countdown I'm gonna burn it down, down, down I'm gonna burn it down  9, 8, 7, 6-5-4, 3, 2, 1, fun!  Echoes knocking on locked doors All the laughter from before I'd rather live out on the street Than in this haunted memory  I've called the movers, called the maids We'll try to exorcise this place Drag my mattress to the yard Crumble, tumble house of cards  This used to be a funhouse But now it's full of evil clowns It's time to start the countdown I'm gonna burn it down, down, down This used to be a funhouse  But now it's full of evil clowns It's time to start the countdown I'm gonna burn it down, down, down I'm gonna burn it down 9, 8, 7, 6-5-4, 3, 2, 1, fun!  I'm crawling through the doggy door  My key don't fit my lock no more I'll change the drapes, I'll break the plates I'll find a new place, burn this fucker down!

Seven o'clock in the morning And the rays from the sun wakes me I'm stretchin' and yawnin' In a bed that don't belong to me And a voice yells, "Good morning, darlin", from the bathroom Then she comes out and kisses me And to my surprise, she ain't you  Now I've got this dumb look on my face Like, what have I done? How could I be so stupid to be have laid here til the morning sun? Must of lost the track of time Oh, what was on my mind? From the club, went to her home  Didn't plan to stay that long  Here I am, quickly tryin' to put on my clothes Searching for my car keys Tryin' to get on up out the door Then she streched her hands in front of it Said, "You can't go this way" Looked at her, like she was crazy Said, "Woman move out my way" Said, "I got a wife at home"  She said, "Please don't go out there"  "Lady, I've got to get home" She said, her husband was comin' up the stairs  "Shh, shh, quiet Hurry up and get in the closet" She said, "Don't you make a sound Or some shit is going down"  I said, "Why don't I just go out the window?"

The four of us... In total shock... Me and her. I closed my mouth and swallowed spit, And I'm thinking to myself, "This is some deep shit!" And I said "So you're gonna tell me he's the one he's been talking to?" He says, "Yes", I say, "No", he says, "Yes", I say, "No", he says, "It's the truth!"  I said, "All of you all ass is crazy, let me up out this door, Because this is way more than I bargained for" And then she says, "Wait, I'm sure we can all fix this" Then I said, "I'm late, plus I ain't gotta damn thing to do with this!" But then she said, "Wouldn't you just like to know how it all began?" Then I thought to myself, and said, 'Quick, you got three minutes' Then it got real quiet, I said, "Somebody start talking"  She said, "My God, Rufus! I've got just one question, how could you do something like this? I'm so hurt!" He looked at her and said, "Bitch please, you've got your nerves With all your club hoppin', lyin', saying you was shoppin'. And now here you are in our home, and you're callin' me wrong."  She said, "Okay, you busted me! And that much I agree, you caught me cheating! But this is a little extreme!"  He said, "You are my wife sleeping behind my back. And now I come home and you got him in the closet, how extreme is that?!" And she said, "But she's a he!" And he said, "Please, you can't judge me" She said, "Rufus this is crazy!" And I said, "Stop arguing! I did not stay here to hear you chew each other out, So get to the point, or I swear I'm out!"  "Excuse me, please, but I think I can explain what's going on in here. My name is Chuck and I been knowing Rufus about a year, At midnight creeping around with him has been a living hell, sneaking in and out of hotels..." I said, "Brother, spare the details!" Then Rufus said, "Chuck, please! Don't say nothing else!" Then she screams, "Rufus you son of a bitch," He says, "Cathy, go to hell!" I said, "I thought you said your name was Mary, that what you said at the party. Man this is getting scary I'm gonna shoot somebody!" Then Rufus start yelling and screaming saying, "Cathy, this is all your fault!" She throws a pillow at him and says, "You were creeping too, the only difference is you didn't get caught!" Chuck screamed out, "We're in love!" Cathy says, "Love my ass!" Rufus said they're getting married then I shoot one in the air!  I said, "Not another one of you sons of bitches say a word! Cause all this shit I'm goin through is unheard!" I grabbed my cellular I said, "This is so wrong," I call up my home, And a man picks up the phone phone phone phone...

Instead of thinking about who gonna die to day, The Lord is gonna help you feel better, so you ain't gotta cry today.

Young girl, don't cry I'll be right here when your world starts to fall Young girl, it's all right Your tears will dry, you'll soon be free to fly  When you're safe inside your room you tend to dream Of a place where nothing's harder than it seems No one ever wants or bothers to explain Of the heartache life can bring and what it means  When there's no one else Look inside yourself Like your oldest friend Just trust the voice within Then you'll find the strength That will guide your way If you will learn to begin To trust the voice within  Young girl, don't hide You'll never change if you just run away Young girl, just hold tight And soon you're gonna see your brighter day Now in a world where innocence is quickly claimed It's so hard to stand your ground when you're so afraid No one reaches out a hand for you to hold When you're lost outside look inside to your soul  When there's no one else Look inside yourself Like your oldest friend Just trust the voice within Then you'll find the strength That will guide your way If you will learn to begin To trust the voice within Yeah...  Life is a journey It can take you anywhere you choose to go As long as you're learning You'll find all you'll ever need to know (BE STRONG) You'll breake it (HOLD ON) You'll make it  Just don't go forsaking yourself (No one can tell you what you can't do) No one can stop you You know that I'm talking to you When there's no one else Look inside yourself Like your oldest friend Just trust the voice within Then you'll find the strength That will guide your way If you will learn to begin To trust the voice within Young girl don't cry I'll be right here when your world starts to fall

Back when I was a child Before life removed all the innocence My father would lift me high And dance with my mother and me and then Spin me around till I fell asleep Then up the stairs he would carry me And I knew for sure I was loved  If I could get another chance Another walk, another dance with him I'd play a song that would never ever end How I'd love love love, to dance with my father again  When I and my mother would disagree To get my way, I would run from her to him He'd make me laugh just to comfort me (yeah) Then finally make me do just what my mamma said Later that night when I was asleep He left a dollar under my sheet Never dreamed that he would be gone from me  If I could steal one final glance One final step, one final dance with him I'd play a song that would never, ever end Cause I'd love, love, love to dance with my father again  Sometimes I'd listen outside her door And I'd hear how my mother cried for him I'd pray for her even more than me I'd pray for her even more than me  I know I'm praying for much too much But could you send back the only man she loved I know you don't do it usually But dear Lord she' s dying to dance with my father again Every night I fall asleep and this is all I ever dream

Tears on my pillow, wherever you go I'll cry me a river that leads to your ocean  You never see me fall apart In the words of a broken heart It's just emotions that's taken me over Caught up in sorrow, lost in my song But if you don't come back Come home to me, darling Don't you know there's  Nobody left in this world to hold me tight And don't you know there's Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight  Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight...

Tears on my pillow, wherever you go I'll cry me a river that leads to your ocean You never see me fall apart In the words of a broken heart It's just emotions that's taken me over  Caught up in sorrow, lost in my soul But if you don't come back Come home to me, darling Nobody left in this world to hold me tight  Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight Goodnight, goodnight And where are you now, now that I need you?

I ran into a friend of yours the other day And I asked her how you've been She said my girl is fine; just bought a house, got a job, real good man I told her I was glad for you; that's wonderful But does she ever ask 'bout me? She said she's happy with her life right now Let her go, let her be And I told myself I would, but something in my heart just would not let you go I just wanna know  What if we were wrong about each other? What if you were really made for me?  What if we was 'sposed to be together? Would that not mean anything? What if that was 'sposed to be my house that you go home to every day? How can you be sure that things are better? If you can't be sure your heart is still here with me Still wanting me  Your friend asked me if there was someone special in my life that I was seeing I told her there was no one in particular  There's just I, myself, and me I told her that I dream of you quite often She just cut her eyes at me She said you got a home, you're very happy So just stop your meddling I told her that I won't I said things were cool, but I guess I was wrong I still can't move on  Now that could be my car That could be my house That could be my baby boy that you're nursing  That could be the trash that I always take out That could be the chair that I love to chill in That could be my food on the table at the end of the day Hugs and the kisses, all the love we make What the hell do you expect me to say? What if it's really 'sposed to be this way? What if you're really 'sposed to be with me?
